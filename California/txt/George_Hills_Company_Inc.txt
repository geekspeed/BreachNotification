            RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH
Dear <Name>:
George Hills Company, Inc., (GHC) is a third party administrator that provides claims administration and litigation
management services for California’s public sector and private insurance carriers for general liability and property
claims. Because of the importance of protecting information provided by individuals, GHC is writing to inform you
of an incident involving information associated with a claim you have with <name of public entity>.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Systema Software is a third party service provider to GHC that provides and hosts a website application for claims
management. Systema Software notified GHC on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for
the application and eliminate the issue.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
GHC conducted an investigation of the incident and learned that Systema Software had corrected the access issue
and Systema Software also hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and
to determine the extent of the access. GHC also learned that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user
to access the databases. The security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and
self-reported the issue. The Texas Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security
researcher who stated under oath that: (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application
to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he
turned over contains the only copy of the information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any
unauthorized use of the information.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?
The information regarding your claim that was in the database includes your name, driver’s license number, and
medical information related to your claim.
WHAT YOU CAN DO.
Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the
databases was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of
this incident and included information on what you can do to protect yourself.
FOR MORE INFORMATION.
We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. For more information, please contact us at 877-841-8161, Monday
through Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

            RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH
Dear Parent or Guardian of <Name>:
George Hills Company, Inc., (GHC) is a third party administrator that provides claims administration and litigation
management services for California’s public sector and private insurance carriers for general liability and property
claims. Because of the importance of protecting information provided by individuals, GHC is writing to inform you
of an incident involving information associated with a claim you have with <name of public entity>.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Systema Software is a third party service provider to GHC that provides and hosts a website application for claims
management. Systema Software notified GHC on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for
the application and eliminate the issue.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
GHC conducted an investigation of the incident and learned that Systema Software had corrected the access issue
and Systema Software also hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and
to determine the extent of the access. GHC also learned that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user
to access the databases. The security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and
self-reported the issue. The Texas Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security
researcher who stated under oath that: (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application
to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he
turned over contains the only copy of the information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any
unauthorized use of the information.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?
The information regarding your claim that was in the database includes your child’s name, social security number,
and medical information related to your claim.
WHAT YOU CAN DO.
Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the
databases was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of
this incident and included information on what you can do to protect yourself.
FOR MORE INFORMATION.
We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. For more information, please contact us at 877-841-8161, Monday
through Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

            RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH
Dear <Name>:
George Hills Company, Inc., (GHC) is a third party administrator that provides claims administration and litigation
management services for California’s public sector and private insurance carriers for general liability and property
claims. Because of the importance of protecting information provided by individuals, GHC is writing to inform you
of an incident involving information associated with a claim you have with <name of public entity>.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Systema Software is a third party service provider to GHC that provides and hosts a website application for claims
management. Systema Software notified GHC on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for
the application and eliminate the issue.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
GHC conducted an investigation of the incident and learned that Systema Software had corrected the access issue
and Systema Software also hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and
to determine the extent of the access. GHC also learned that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user
to access the databases. The security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and
self-reported the issue. The Texas Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security
researcher who stated under oath that: (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application
to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he
turned over contains the only copy of the information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any
unauthorized use of the information.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?
The information regarding your claim that was in the database includes your name and social security number.
WHAT YOU CAN DO.
Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the
databases was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of
this incident and included information on what you can do to protect yourself.
FOR MORE INFORMATION.
We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. For more information, please contact us at 877-841-8161, Monday
through Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

Sincerely,



John E. Chaquica, CEO
