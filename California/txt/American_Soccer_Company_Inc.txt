Dear SCORE Customer,


We value your business, and we have important information for you to help protect the privacy
and security of your personal information, a matter SCORE takes very seriously.

On October 21, 2014, SCORE discovered a potential unauthorized data breach that occurred on
September 4, 2014, which involved some information from our website customers. Immediately
after this discovery, we began an internal investigation and have partnered with an external IT
firm to secure the website payments, rapidly gather facts, and provide information to our
customers.

The compromised information included name, payment card account number, expiration date,
and SCORE account number, for those who submitted orders on www.scoresports.com,
between the dates of June 1, 2014 â€“ September 4, 2014. At this time, there is no evidence that
customer addresses or card security codes were compromised.

It is always a good idea to review your payment card statements carefully and call your bank or
card issuer if you see any suspicious transactions. The policies of the payment card brands such
as American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa provide that you have zero liability for any
unauthorized charges if you report them in a timely manner.

You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity
theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC). To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-
877-IDTHEFT (877-438-4338).

Additionally, you are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the
three national credit bureaus, whose contact information is below. To order your free credit
report, you can also visit www.annualcreditreport.com , call toll-free at 877-322-8228, or
complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit
Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

You may also consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. This alert informs creditors of
possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to
establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact the
three credit bureaus below.
You may also wish to place a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze will prevent
creditors from accessing your credit file at the three nationwide credit bureaus below. Please be
aware, though, that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay or prevent the
timely approval of any requests you make for employment, new loans, or other services. Also,
the credit bureau may charge a reasonable fee to place a security freeze on your credit file.

We know this breach may have had a real impact on you, causing concern. We share those
feelings. We have taken immediate and secure measures to ensure that you can trust us with
your future orders. We appreciate your patronage, and if you have any questions please contact
us at 1-800-626-7774.

Sincerely,
SCORE
