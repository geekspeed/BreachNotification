Dear <Customer first name>,

We are contacting you because we learned on August 7 that your site password and contact information,
such as name, address and email address, may have been accessed on the J.P. Morgan Corporate
Challenge website. In reviewing our systems, we identified suspicious server activity involving some login
information.

None of your banking or other financial information was viewed. We have taken steps to prevent
unauthorized access to the site’s database.

We encourage you to avoid using the same password at multiple sites and to change all your passwords
regularly.

We apologize, and we appreciate your involvement in the J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge. If you have
questions, please call us at 1-888-745-0091, seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Central Time or

Sincerely,
