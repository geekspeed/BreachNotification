Dear Customer,

The privacy of our customers has always been important to State Farm. I am notifying all State Farm customers
with whom my agency has had a relationship, as well as any prospective customers for whom we may have
information, about an incident which occurred in my office. On March 6, 2012, an investigation confirmed the
incident described below.

This incident involved an employee who formerly worked in my office. While employed, and contrary to the
business practices of my office, the employee allegedly used customer information inappropriately. This
information may have included names, addresses, credit card numbers and social security numbers. We have
been unable to confirm which customers’ information was allegedly misused by this person.

I am notifying you about this incident and providing the information below, so that you can take proper steps to
guard against potential unauthorized activity on your accounts. I greatly appreciate your business and sincerely
apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause.

As a precautionary measure and at our expense, State Farm is offering you a 12-month subscription to a credit
                                                                     ®
monitoring and identity theft protection service called TrueCredit . This service will provide you with a copy of

In addition, we offer the following information for general awareness:

 You should remain vigilant by reviewing and monitoring your accounts and credit reports. Report suspected
  incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or your state Attorney General’s office. Information about
  identity theft, fraud alerts, and security freezes can be obtained from the sources listed below.

 If you discover suspicious activity on any of your billings and other accounts, notify the issuer of the
  fraudulent use and cancel the existing account. You may want to contact the fraud department of one of the
  credit reporting agencies below to place a fraud alert on your consumer credit report. A fraud alert tells
  creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or make changes to your existing accounts.

 You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report annually from each of the three major reporting
  agencies. You may request it through one of the following methods:
             Phone: toll free number – 1-877-322-8228
             Online: www.annualcreditreport.com
             U.S. Mail: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281

 You may place a “security freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is
  designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report at the three national credit bureaus
  without your consent.
       There may be fees for placing, lifting or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5
          to $20 per action. There is no charge, however, to lift or remove a security freeze if you provide the
          credit bureaus with a valid police report. You have a right to obtain a police report if you are a victim
          of identity theft.
       Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit
          bureau listed above. Because the instructions for how to establish a security freeze differ from state
          to state, please contact the three credit bureaus to find out more information.

 Additional guidance on what identity theft is and how to report suspected fraudulent transactions can be
  obtained from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC):
               Phone: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); or TTY: 1-866-653-4261
               Online: www.ftc.gov/IDTheft

                  Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580

I truly regret the inconvenience and concern this situation may have caused you. Should you have questions
about this incident, please do not hesitate to contact me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
Monday-Friday, or 9:00 a.m. to noon on Saturdays.

Sincerely,




xxxxxxxxxxxx, Agent

                                             Frequently Asked Questions


1 – Should I place a fraud alert with one of the credit reporting agencies?

The person affected should be the one to make that decision. You should consider that while doing so would

stays in place for 90 days.

all consumers should consider.
