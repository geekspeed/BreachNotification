Dear John Q Sample,

Yusen Logistics (Americas) Inc. (‚ÄúYLA‚Äù) is committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of information
regarding our current and former employees. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you about an incident involving
some of that information.

On the morning of September 24, 2013, we learned that a password-protected, unencrypted laptop computer issued
to a YLA employee was stolen from the employee‚Äôs vehicle the night before. The incident was reported to the
police and we immediately began a thorough investigation to determine the information that may have been stored
on the laptop. Our investigation confirmed that the laptop contained a spreadsheet that included payroll deduction
information for current and former YLA employees between July and September 2013. Specifically, the
spreadsheet included your name, address, Social Security number, and payroll benefit deduction amount. To date,
the computer has not been located.

We have no reason to believe that the laptop was taken for the information it contained or that your information has
been accessed or used improperly. However, out of abundance of caution, we have arranged to have AllClear ID
