      Account Security Notice from WhatGreatSkin.com
      At WhatGreatSkin.com, we take account security very seriously and use industry
      standard encryption to ensure that your account information is kept secure.
      This afternoon at 3:30PM PST, our servers were hit with an organized attack, which
      was immediately detected by our server administrators. Our server administration
      team discovered that the following account information may have been
      compromised: customer names, addresses, and credit card details.

      WhatGreatSkin.com was immediately taken offline to prevent further access, and all
      credit card information was wiped from our secure database to make it completely
      inaccessible to further attempts. At this time, it is unclear if the data compromised
      can be used to make unauthorized charges.
      WhatGreatSkin.com will not contact you in any way, including by email,
      asking for your credit card information, social security number, or any other
      personally identifiable information.
      If you are asked for that information, you can be confident that
      WhatGreatSkin.com is not the entity asking.
      We thank you for your patience as we complete our investigation of this incident,
      and regret any inconvenience. We’ve restored service and are performing a
      complete security audit.
