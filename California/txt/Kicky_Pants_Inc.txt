                                                Notice of Data Breach
What Happened

Dear <<Name>>,
On December 31, 2015, Kicky Pants, Inc., d/b/a KicKee Pants discovered evidence of a data security breach that
allowed some confidential customer information to be acquired by an unknown third party. We believe that the
acquisitions occurred between the dates of September 24, 2015 and December 26, 2015. Kicky Pants discovered this
on December 31, 2015, and we closed the breach immediately. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that there
have been any actual attempts to misuse any of the acquired information.

What Information Was Involved

The compromised information included first and last names; credit card number, expiration date, and security code;
billing address (street, city, state, and ZIP code); telephone number; and email address.

O5972 v.04 01.21.2016
                              Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

Please Note: Minors under the age of 18 should not have a credit history established and are under the age to
secure credit. Therefore, credit monitoring may not be applicable at this time. All other services provided in
the membership will apply. No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you. Please
follow the instructions below to place the alert.

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to www.myidcare.com/kickeepants and follow the instructions for enrollment using
your Access Code provided above. Once you have completed your enrollment, you will receive a welcome letter by
email (or by mail if you do not provide an email address when you sign up). The welcome letter will direct you to the
exclusive ID Experts Member Website where you will find other valuable educational information.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your membership with ID Experts, which is paid for by
Kicky Pants, Inc. Credit monitoring is included in the membership, but you must personally activate it for it to be
effective. Note: You must have established credit, access to a computer, and the internet to use this service. If you
need assistance, ID Experts will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact ID Experts at 866-833-7924 to gain additional information about this event and speak with
knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and
monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every twelve months to one free copy of your
credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to
www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a
free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with ID Experts, notify them immediately by calling or by
visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.

If you file a theft report with ID Experts, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who will
help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a
consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Experts Recovery Advocate who will work on your behalf
to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly.

You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note
that, in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to
provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items.
You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this
after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone
and also via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including
contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud
alert can protect you but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three
bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus

Equifax Fraud Reporting           Experian Fraud Reporting           TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-525-6285                    1-888-397-3742                     1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 740241                   P.O. Box 9554                      P.O. Box 2000
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241            Allen, TX 75013                    Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.alerts.equifax.com            www.experian.com                   www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three
bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive
confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying
information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will
need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind

O5973 v.04 01.21.2016
that, when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card
until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live
in and for each credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or
remove a freeze. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement
agency or submitted an ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there may be no charge to
place the freeze.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following
agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused
to file a complaint with them.
