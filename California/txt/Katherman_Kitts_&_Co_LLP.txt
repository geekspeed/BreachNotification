       Dear John Sample:

       As a most valued client of our firm, I am writing to let you know of an unfortunate incident that recently took place
       and the measures we are taking to minimize risk of any negative consequences.

       What Happened?
       On February 25, 2016, hard drives containing backup files for one of the firm’s servers, along with other incidental
       items, were stolen from a partner’s locked vehicle. These files may have contained some of your confidential
       information as a client of Katherman Kitts & Co. LLP. The partner discovered the theft later that evening and
       immediately notified the Long Beach Police Department. We are continuing to work with law enforcement to locate
       the stolen hard drives.

       What Information Was Involved?
       The information stored on the hard drives may include your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number,
       and other information typcially included in your tax return.

       What We Are Doing.
       We have no reason to believe that the drives were stolen for the information they contained or that the information
       has been accessed or used in any way. There is nothing on the exterior of the drives to indicate what is on them and
       we have consulted a technology expert who has confirmed it would take a fairly sophisticated criminal with
       technical expertise to access the information. In addition, our private investigator told us the theft had all the
       markings of a random event, likely carried out by local teenagers because other cars were also broken into and
       stolen credit cards were immediately used to purchase video games and movie rentals. Nevertheless we are taking
       no chances and have taken steps to closely monitor the situation and to mitigate risk of client information exposure
       by arranging for AllClear ID to protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you. The following identity
       protection services start on the date of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 12 months.

                                  AllClear SECURE: The team at AllClear ID is ready and standing by if you need identity repair assistance.
                                  This service is automatically available to you with no enrollment required. If a problem arises, simply call
                                  1-855-865-4458 and a dedicated investigator will help recover financial losses, restore your credit and make
                                  sure your identity is returned to its proper condition.

                                  AllClear PRO: This service offers additional layers of protection including credit monitoring and a $1
                                  million identity theft insurance policy. For a child under 18 years old, AllClear ID ChildScan identifies
                                  acts of credit, criminal, medical or employment fraud against children by searching thousands of public
                                  databases for use of your child’s information. To use the PRO service, you will need to provide your
                                  personal information to AllClear ID. You may sign up online at enroll.allclearid.com or by phone by
                                  calling 1-855-865-4458 using the following redemption code: Redemption Code. Please note: Additional
                                  steps may be required by you in order to activate your phone alerts and monitoring options.

We have taken steps to thoroughly review all of our security protocols to make sure they are clear, unambiguous and
understood by everyone in our office. We are re-enforcing education and training for our employees regarding the
importance of handling information securely and are implementing additional technical safeguards to protect
information in our care. We are confident we have taken the correct steps to ensure that a similar incident will not
happen in the future.

What You Can Do.
We encourage you to take advantage of the identity theft protection services being offered. Further, you should
remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing credit card, bank, and other financial
statements for any unauthorized activity.

We recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report
from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online
at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report
Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box
105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of
the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

         Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com

         TransUnion, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19016, 1-877-322-8228, www.transunion.com

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should
promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement
authorities, including local law enforcement, your state’s attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission
(“FTC”). You may contact the FTC or your state’s regulatory authority to obtain additional information about
avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center 600
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors
on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud
alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An
initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your
credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended
fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting
any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the toll-free numbers listed below:

             Equifax                                  Experian                               TransUnion

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so
that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get
access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws
vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state,
generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a
credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit
freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find
out more information.
