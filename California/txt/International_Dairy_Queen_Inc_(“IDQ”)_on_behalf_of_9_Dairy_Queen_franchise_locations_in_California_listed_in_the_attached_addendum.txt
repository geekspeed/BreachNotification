ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We encourage affected customers to take the following steps:


Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call
toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission's (“FTC”) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report
Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three nationwide consumer reporting
agencies provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.
When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the
“inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven't requested credit. Some companies bill
under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to
tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal information” section for any inaccuracies in your
information (such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not
understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this
information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting
agencies of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the
information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges
you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in
writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information can't be
explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that can't be explained also
should be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.


Identity Repair Services. We are offering affected customers in the U.S. who used their payment card at
one of the impacted Dairy Queen locations or the one impacted Orange Julius location during the relevant
time period identity repair services (AllClear SECURE) from AllClear ID for one year at no cost to them.
These services start on October 9, 2014 and will be available at any time during the next 12 months.
These services provide affected customers with a dedicated investigator to assist them with fraud-related
issues arising from this incident. These services are automatically available to affected customers and no
enrollment is required. Affected customers may receive these fraud assistance services by calling 1-855-
865-4456.
  Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your
  payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly
  report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC and your state Attorney General. If you believe your
  identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps:
 Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Use
 the FTC's ID Theft Affidavit (available at www.ftc.gov/idtheft) when you dispute new unauthorized accounts.
 File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that
 may require proof of the identity theft crime.



  You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity
  theft and how to repair identity theft:
     Federal Trade Commission
     Consumer Response Center
     600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
     Washington, DC 20580

  Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft,
  consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of
  an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of
  someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity
  theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a
  fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach
  an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer
  reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described
  above.

  Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security freeze”
  (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential
  creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There
  may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per
  action. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer
  reporting agency individually. For more information on security freezes, you may contact the three
nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the FTC as described above. As the instructions for
establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three nationwide consumer
reporting agencies to find out more information.
The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For
example, you may be asked to provide:
Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)
Your Social Security number
Your date of birth
Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver's license or military ID card)
Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)



For Maryland Residents. You can obtain information from the Maryland Office of the Attorney General
about steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may contact the Maryland Attorney General at:
  Maryland Office of the Attorney General
  Consumer Protection Division
  200 St. Paul Place
  Baltimore, MD 21202
  (888) 743-0023 (toll-free in Maryland)
  (410) 576-6300
  www.oag.state.md.us


For Massachusetts Residents. You have the right to obtain a police report and request a security
freeze. The consumer reporting agencies may charge you a fee of up to $5 to place a security freeze on
your account, and may require that you provide certain personal information (such as your name, Social
Security number, date of birth, and address) and proper identification (such as a copy of a government-
issued ID card and a bill or statement) prior to honoring your request for a security freeze. There is no
charge, however, to place, lift or remove a security freeze if you have been a victim of identity theft and
you provide the consumer reporting agencies with a valid police report.


For North Carolina Residents. You can obtain information from the North Carolina Attorney General's
Office about preventing identity theft. You can contact the North Carolina Attorney General at:
   North Carolina Attorney General's Office
   9001 Mail Service Center
   Raleigh, NC 27699-9001
   (877) 566-7226 (toll-free in North Carolina)

  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  October 9, 2014
INTERNATIONAL DAIRY QUEEN CONFIRMS MALWARE INTRUSION AT SOME U.S.
LOCATIONS

  EDINA, MINN. — International Dairy Queen, Inc. today confirmed that the systems of some DQ® locations
  and one Orange Julius® location in the U.S. had been infected with the widely-reported Backoff malware
  that is targeting retailers across the country. The company previously indicated that it was investigating a
  possible malware intrusion that may have affected some payment cards used at certain DQ locations in
  the U.S. Upon learning of the issue, the company conducted an extensive investigation and retained
  external forensic experts to help determine the facts. Because nearly all DQ and Orange Julius locations
  are independently owned and operated, the company worked closely with affected franchise owners, as
  well as law enforcement authorities and the payment card brands, to assess the nature and scope of the
  issue. The investigation revealed that a third-party vendor’s compromised account credentials were used
  to access systems at some locations.


  The investigation has established the following:
 The Backoff malware only impacted payment card data at 395 of the more than 4,500 U.S. locations.
 The time periods during which the Backoff malware was present on the relevant systems vary by location. A
 list of impacted locations, as well as the relevant time periods, is available at
 www.dq.com/datasecurityincident/.
 The affected systems contained payment card customer names, numbers and expiration dates. The company
 has no evidence that other customer personal information, such as Social Security numbers, PINs or email
  addresses, was compromised as a result of this malware infection.
  Based on our investigation, we are confident that this malware has been contained.



  “We are committed to working with and supporting our affected DQ and Orange Julius franchise owners to
  address this incident,” said John Gainor, president and CEO of International Dairy Queen. “Our customers
  continue to be our top priority.” The company is offering free identity repair services for one year to
  customers in the U.S. who used their payment card at one of the impacted DQ locations or the one
  Orange Julius location during the relevant time period. The company has posted information about these
  services and other steps that affected DQ and Orange Julius customers can take to help protect
  themselves on the company’s website at www.dq.com/datasecurityincident/.
