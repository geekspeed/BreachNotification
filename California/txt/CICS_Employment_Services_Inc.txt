Dear <First Name> <Last Name>,
I am writing to inform you of an incident that may affect the security of your personal information. We were recently
notified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the FBI) that personal information we processed regarding an
application you made for employment may have been accessed without authorization. This information included
your name, address, date of birth and Social Security number. We do not know how or when the alleged unauthorized
access may have occurred. The FBI’s forensic examinations of relevant portions of our computer network, database
and third party storage provider revealed no evidence of any compromise. However, because of the credible nature of
the alleged unauthorized access, we are taking the notification seriously and informing you. Out of an abundance of
caution, and at our expense, credit monitoring services will be provided to you as explained below.
In addition to the FBI’s forensic examination, we launched our own investigation into this matter. We immediately
engaged the services of an independent forensics investigation firm to determine whether CICS’ security had been
compromised. The forensic examinations revealed no evidence that our network or database have been compromised.
To ensure the security of all personally identifiable information (PII) in our database, however, and due to our
concerns about it being a vendor related breach, we changed web hosts and have ensured that all PII contained in
our network is encrypted and secure. The FBI’s investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are providing any
assistance they might need.
As an added precaution and as a service to you, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect your identity for 12
months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the date of this notice and you can use
them at any time during the next 12 months.

1-855-865-4453 and a dedicated investigator will do the work to recover financial losses, restore your credit and make

AllClear PRO: This service offers additional layers of protection including credit monitoring and a $1 million
identity theft insurance policy. To use the PRO service, you will need to provide your personal information to
AllClear ID. You may sign up online at www.enroll.allclearid.com or by phone by calling 1-855-865-4453 using

                                   Information about Identity Theft Prevention

It is recommended that you remain vigilant for any incidents of fraud or identity theft by regularly reviewing credit
card account statements and your credit report for unauthorized activity. You may obtain a free copy of your credit
report from the following national consumer reporting agencies or from the Annual Credit Report Request Service,
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281, 1-877-322-8228, www.annualcreditreport.com:

      Equifax: P.O. Box105139, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
      Experian: P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
      TransUnion: P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790, 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or your
respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected
identity theft to local law enforcement, the FTC, or your respective Attorney General. The FTC may be contacted
at FTC, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-438-4338,
www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the
Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202,
1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us.

For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from
the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office, Consumer Protection Division, 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC
27699-9001, 1-877-1-877-566-7226, www.ncdoj.gov.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on
notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert
be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial
fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report
if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert
stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free
fraud number of any of the three national consumer reporting agencies listed below.

      Equifax: 1-800-525-6285, www.equifax.com
      Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
      TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, www.transunion.com

Credit Freezes (for Non-Massachusetts Residents): You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a
security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number
that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from
accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third
parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a
credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a
credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a
credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting agency. Unlike a fraud alert,
you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting agency. Since the instructions for
how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major consumer reporting agencies
as specified below to find out more information:

      Equifax: P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
      Experian: P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
      TransUnion: P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA, 19022-2000, www.transunion.com

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national
consumer reporting agencies listed above.
