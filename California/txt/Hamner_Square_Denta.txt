Dear Patient:

We are writing to inform you of the following incident and the steps we have taken and are taking to respond to it. On May 10, 2012, in the
course, of upgrading to a new imaging and management software called Eaglesoft to better serve you, a representative of one of our dental
practice’s business partners, Patterson Dental, visited our offices and, without our knowledge or consent in violation of our policies and
procedures in exporting your data for the new systems conversion process had placed an unencrypted USB memory chip containing data from
our practice into a sealed envelope and deposited it at a local post office to be sent through the U.S. mail to their technical headquarters. On
May 14, 2012, this envelope arrived at its destination with a tear on the side and without the USB memory chip. The representative and this
business partner have searched and continue to search for this USB memory chip, but have not located it to date. They believe it is most likely
that the memory chip was “squeezed out” of the envelope and the envelope torn when the letter was put through a processing machine at the
post office. We were notified by Patterson Dental on May 18, 2012 of this occurrence. Since that time when we were notified about the
missing USB memory chip, we, along with Patterson Dental, have been investigating and continue to investigate this incident. We are taking
steps to enhance our security procedures to protect our information to prevent such an incident from happening again.
The USB memory chip contained information, including names, home addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, ID numbers, dates of
birth, driver’s license numbers, social security numbers, dental information and dental insurance information of some of our patients. We have
not received any report of fraud or identity theft from any of our patients and are otherwise unable to determine whether your information was
ever in fact accessed by an unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, we are alerting you so you can take steps to protect
yourself from possible fraud and identity theft.

Please remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft and review account statements and monitor free credit reports.
Contact information for the three credit agencies is as follows:

              1-888-397-3742                                      1-800-685-1111                                    1-800-680-7289

If you think someone has misused your personal information, call one of the credit agencies and ask them to put an initial fraud alert on your
credit report. Placing an initial fraud alert allows you to obtain a free credit report from each of the three credit agencies. You may also consider
contacting each of the three credit agencies to place a credit freeze on your file.

Also, please report any suspected incidents of identity theft to law enforcement authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or to
the State Attorney General.

You may file a complaint with the FTC at www.ftc.gov/complaint or 1-877-438-4338.

You may close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. Use the FTC’s ID Theft
Affidavit (available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/resources/forms/affidavit.pdf) when you dispute new unauthorized accounts.

You may take your FTC complaint to your local police and file a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your
creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.
We deeply regret this incident and any concern or inconvenience that this may cause you. If you have any questions regarding this notice,
please contact Sharee Dinh at 909-923-2273, 6987 Hamner Avenue, Suite 5, Corona, CA 92880.

We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you.
Sincerely,


Lan Thai Dinh, D.D.S.

You can obtain additional information about protection against identity theft from the California Office of Privacy Protection website at

Social Security Number

Because your Social Security number may have been involved, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files. A fraud alert
requires potential creditors to use what the law refers to as “reasonable policies and procedures” to verify your identity before issuing credit in
your name. A fraud alert lasts for 90 days. Just call one of the three credit reporting agencies at a number below. This will let you automatically
place an alert with all of the agencies. You will receive letters from all three, confirming the fraud alert and letting you know how to get a free
copy of your credit report from each.

        Experian 1-888-397-3742 Equifax 1-800-525-6285 TransUnion 1-800-680-7289

When you receive your credit reports, look them over carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look for inquiries from creditors that you
did not initiate. And look for personal information, such as home address and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything
you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.

If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriff’s office and file a police report of identity theft. Get a copy
of the police report. You may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records.

Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, we recommend that you check your credit reports periodically. You can keep the
fraud alert in place by calling again after 90 days.

If there is anything that Hamner Square Dental can do to assist you, please call us at 909-923-2273.

California Driver’s License or Identification Card Number

Since your California driver’s license or California Identification Card number may have been involved, we recommend that you call the DMV
Fraud Hotline at 1-866-658-5758 to report it. Continue with above advice on placing a fraud alert on credit files.
Dental Information or Dental Insurance Information

We recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from us, your plan, your insurer. If you see any
service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your plan, your insurer at the number on the statement. If you do not receive
regular explanation of benefits statements, contact your provider or plan and request them to send such statements following the provision of
services in your name or number.

You may want to order copies of your credit reports and check for any dental bills that you do not recognize. If you find anything suspicious, call
the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the report. You can order your reports from the three credit reporting agencies for free each
year by calling 1-877-322-8228 or going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

Keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your dental records. You may also want to request a copy of your
dental records from you insurance provider to serve as a baseline.

If there is anything that we can do to assist you, please call us at (909) 923-2273.
