       Dear John Sample,

                                                         NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

       As an integral part of our dōTERRA family, we understand how important data security is to
       you.

       What Happened?

       We are writing to notify you today that a third-party vendor that provides dōTERRA with data
       hosting and software services recently informed us that an intruder had accessed some of the
       vendor’s systems.

       What Information Was Involved?

       The intrusion appears to have resulted in the unauthorized acquisition in March 2016 of personal
       information of some of our Wellness Advocates and customers, and may have included names,
       Social Security numbers (or other government-issued identification numbers), payment card
       information (including full or partial card numbers, security codes and expiration dates), dates of
       birth, postal and email addresses, telephone numbers, and usernames and passwords. dōTERRA
       is working closely with law enforcement authorities and leading security experts to address the
       issue.

       What We Are Doing

       We take our obligation to safeguard your personal information very seriously. Be assured that
       we at dōTERRA are taking extensive measures to protect your information and have engaged
       industry-leading security firms to assist us. dōTERRA also has been investing heavily for some
       time now to implement its own state-of-the-art systems to support growth and expansion and
       enhance security. These efforts continue to proceed on track. We look forward to sharing more
       information about these new systems in the coming year.




                                                                                       ,A.QAC^!^P

We encourage you to take the following steps:

Register for Identity Protection and Credit Monitoring Services. We have arranged with
AllClear ID to offer you identity protection and credit monitoring services for 24 months at no
cost to you.

AllClear SECURE: This service provides you with a dedicated investigator to help you recover
possible financial losses and help restore your credit and identity in the event challenges occur.
You are automatically eligible to use this service – there is no action required on your part to
enroll other than placing a call. You may receive this fraud assistance service by calling 1-855-
904-5752.

AllClear PRO: This service offers additional layers of protection, including credit monitoring
and a $1 million identity theft insurance policy. To use the PRO service, you will need to
provide certain information to AllClear ID. You may sign up online at enroll.allclearid.com or
by phone by calling 1-855-904-5752 using the following redemption code: Redemption Code.

Order Your Free Credit Report.                  To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit
Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) website at
www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit
reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
Look in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit.
Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer
reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal
information” section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social
Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting
agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign
of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies
in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be
investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not
authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in
writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information
can’t be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that can’t be
explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff’s office because it may signal
criminal activity.

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly
notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity
theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC and your state Attorney
General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these
steps:


                                                                               *A.QAC^!^NQ+

   ·   Place an initial fraud alert.
   ·   Order your credit reports.
   ·   Create an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit by submitting a report about the theft at
       http://www.ftc.gov/complaint or by calling the FTC.
   ·   File a police report about the identity theft and get a copy of the police report or the
       report number. Bring your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit with you when you file the
       police report.
   ·   Your Identity Theft Report is your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit plus your police report.
       You may be able to use your Identity Theft Report to remove fraudulent information
       from your credit report, prevent companies from refurnishing fraudulent information to a
       consumer reporting agency, stop a company from collecting a debt that resulted from
       identity theft, place an extended seven-year fraud alert with consumer reporting agencies,
       and obtain information from companies about accounts the identity thief opened or
       misused.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of
identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible
identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you
against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a
merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that
the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to
verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling
any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system
that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For
more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security
freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to
prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies
without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze,
which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security
freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information
on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the
FTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to
state, please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more
information.

The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your
request. For example, you may be asked to provide:

   ·   Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)
   ·   Your Social Security number
   ·   Your date of birth
   ·   Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
   ·   A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s license
       or military ID card)
   ·   Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account
       statement)
