Dear Sample A Sample:
Phoenix House Foundation, Inc. and its affiliates (Phoenix House, we, us) write to inform you of an incident that may
have involved some of your personal information as an employee or former employee of Phoenix House.
What Happened?
On December 22, 2014, Phoenix House learned that, on December 19, 2014, a consultant hired to perform payroll activities
for us appears to have made unauthorized changes in our electronic payroll systems hosted by third parties. Upon learning
this, we immediately removed the consultants access to the systems at issue and conducted an investigation to determine
what information may have been changed.
We are notifying you because the consultant had access to certain personal information, including your name, address, Social
Security number, salary, and benefit information, when they made the unauthorized changes described above. We have
terminated the consultants contract and reported the incident to law enforcement, and we are cooperating with law
enforcement in its investigation of this incident. We also are working to restore the information to its state before the incident
and to update the files for authorized changes that have occurred since the incident.
What is Phoenix House doing to protect me?
While we have received no reports that your information has been used in any manner that would compromise your identity
or credit, out of an abundance of caution, we want to let you know this happened and assure you that we take it very
seriously. Further, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership in Experians® ProtectMyID® Alert. This
product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection services
focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is completely free to you and
enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and ProtectMyID
Alert, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the Activate                     0123456
ProtectMyID Now in Three Easy Steps document enclosed with this letter. Also, please review the enclosed Information
about Identity Theft Protection reference guide on the back of this letter, which describes additional steps you can take to
help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and
details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.
What is Phoenix House doing to prevent this from happening in the future?
To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have terminated the consultants contract and will be
conducting a comprehensive review of our information security practices and procedures.

                                                                   (OVER PLEASE)                                                     A7725-L01
We deeply regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1-877-288-8056,
Monday through Friday from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM Pacific Time and Saturday through Sunday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM
Pacific Time.
Sincerely,


Michael D. Berkowitz
Senior Vice President and Director, Human Resources and Workforce Development

800-685-1111                         888-397-3742                            800-888-4213

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly
report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local
law enforcement, your states attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may contact the FTC or
your states regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal
Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT
(438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft.
For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the
Maryland Office of the Attorney General:
          Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division
          200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us
For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from North
Carolina Attorney Generals Office:
          North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Consumer Protection Division

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice
that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on
your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on
your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been
a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for
seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies
at the toll-free numbers listed below:
 Equifax                                Experian                               TransUnion
 877-478-7625                           888-397-3742                           800-680-7289
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no
new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A
credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you
place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you
temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur
fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily      0123456


lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.
Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the
instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting
companies as specified below to find out more information.
