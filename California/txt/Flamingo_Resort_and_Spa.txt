Dear Employee



Within the last month the Flamingo Resort and Spa discovered a virus on the payroll computer which could have
allowed a hacker to access personal information, such as your social security number, date of birth, home address,
phone number and bank routing numbers (if you do direct deposit for your pay checks). The Flamingo Resort and
Spa is taking further measures to ensure this will not happen in the future.

We recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert lets creditors know to contact you
before opening new accounts. Then call any one of the three credit reporting agencies at the number below. This
will let you automatically place fraud alerts and order your credit report from all three.

Equifax                                         Experian                                        Trans Union

800-525-6285                                    888-397-3742                                    800-680-7289

When you receive your credit reports, look them over carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look for
inquires from creditors that you did not initiate. And look for personal information, such as home address and
Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency at
the telephone number on the report.

If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriffâ€™s office and file a police
report of identity theft. Get a copy of the police report. You may need to give copies of the police report to
creditors to clear up your records.

Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, the California Office of Privacy Protection recommends
that you check your credit report every three months for the next year. Just call one of the numbers above to
order your reports and keep the fraud alert in place.

For more information on identity theft we suggest that you contact the Office of Privacy Protection. The toll-free is
866-785-9663. Or you can visit their web site at www.privacy.ca.gov. If there is anything The Flamingo Resort and
Spa can do to assist you, please call 800-848-8300.
