January 25, 2014



To Our Valued Michaels Customers:

As you may have read in the news, data security attacks against retailers have become a major
topic of concern. We recently learned of possible fraudulent activity on some U.S. payment cards
that had been used at Michaels, suggesting we may have experienced a data security attack.

We are working closely with federal law enforcement and are conducting an investigation with
the help of third-party data security experts to establish the facts. Although the investigation is
ongoing, based on the information we have received and in light of the widely-reported criminal
efforts to penetrate the data systems of U.S. retailers, we believe it is appropriate to notify our
customers that a potential issue may have occurred.

Throughout our 40-year history, our customers have always been our number one priority and
we deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause. The privacy and security of our customersâ€™
information is of critical importance to us and we are focused on addressing this issue.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for unauthorized
charges. If you believe your payment card may have been affected, you should immediately
contact your bank or card issuer. If we find as part of our investigation that any of our customers
were affected, we will offer identity protection and credit monitoring services to them at no cost.

We will provide updates on our website (www.michaels.com) as our investigation continues. In
the meantime, if you have any questions, please call us toll-free at 1- 877-412-7145.
Representatives will be available to answer questions beginning Sunday January 26, 2014, with
operating hours Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. CST to 11:00 p.m. CST and Sunday
from 8:00 a.m. CST to 8:00 p.m. CST.

We apologize and truly regret any concern this may cause you.

Sincerely,


Chuck Rubin
CEO, Michaels Stores
