Dear Mr/Ms_______________:



Under California Law Senate Bill 541, healthcare facilities are required to notify patients of accidental disclosures of
their protected health information to other parties not directly involved in their care.

On April 17, 2013, Sonoma Valley Hospital became aware of health information disclosure related to your services at
Sonoma Valley Hospital. Once we were notified of this issue, we immediately took down our website to delete the file
from our website.

Surgical services covering information from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 was posted onto the Sonoma Valley
Hospital website www.svh.com. This posting had the following data fields.

             •    Patient Name
             •    Date of Service
             •    Procedure
             •    Surgeon
             •    Hospital Charges
             •    Insurance Company Name

 The length of time posted on our website was February 14, 2013 through April 17, 2013. Please be assured
individual information such social security number, drivers license, addresses was not our website.

None of your personal data could be reached by searching our website, and clicking links. Specifically, the Google
search returned results, and our website as a selection for your legal name.

We immediately conducted our investigation, which is now complete. The Chief Information Officer immediately
initiated a process for this error never to repeat.

We apologize for this event, and we want to reassure you that your healthcare and the privacy of your information at
Sonoma Valley Hospital are our number one priority.

If you have any concerns, please call Leanne McDowell at 707-935-5250 or email question(s) to lmcdowell@svh.com
number below. We at Sonoma Valley Hospital value your privacy.

Sincerely,



Richard Reid
Corporate Compliance Committee Chair
