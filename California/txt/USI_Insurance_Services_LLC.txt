Dear John Q Sample

I am writing to you on behalf of Company about a potential security incident. We recently
discovered that certain unauthorized software was uploaded to our computer system. Upon
discovery, we immediately analyzed the software, determined that it was malicious and
removed it. In the course of our investigation, we determined that a hacker, through the
malicious software, had viewed files containing a username and password. We immediately
disabled the compromised username and password and launched an internal investigation to
determine whether the credentials could be used to access personal information stored on our
system. We also hired a third party computer forensics team to assist us in determining the
extent to which our system may have been compromised.

The investigation found that the malicious software was used to view computer files containing
a username and password that could be used to access personal information stored on our
system. It appears that the malicious software was installed around October 2, 2013.
Although we cannot confirm whether your personal information has been accessed, we are
contacting you because your name, mailing address and Clientdef1 were stored on our system
in connection with the Clientdef2 product you received from us.

I would like to emphasize that, to date, we have no evidence that your personal information
was actually accessed or acquired. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, we have
purchased twelve months of AllClear PRO and AllClear SECURE identity protection services
from AllClear ID, at no cost to you. The identity protection services begin on the date of this

Free Credit Report

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (Equifax,
Experian and TransUnion) to provide you annually, upon request, with a free copy of your credit report.
Obtaining a copy of your credit report from each agency on an annual basis, and reviewing it for suspicious
activity, can help you spot problems and address them quickly. You can request your free credit report
online at www.annualcreditreport.com or by phone at 1-877-322-8228. You can also request your free credit
report by completing the request form available at www.annualcreditreport.com, and mailing it to Annual
Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

Fraud Alert

As a precaution against identity theft, you can consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A "fraud
alert" tells creditors to contact you before opening a new account or changing an existing account. A fraud
alert also lets your creditors know to watch for unusual or suspicious activity. To place a fraud alert, call any
one of the three major consumer reporting agencies listed below. An initial fraud alert remains effective for
ninety days, and is free of charge. If you wish, you can renew the fraud alert at the expiration of this initial
period. As soon as one credit agency confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts
on your file.
