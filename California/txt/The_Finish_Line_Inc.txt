Dear Sample A. Sample:

We are writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of your personal information. We are unaware of any attempted or
actual misuse of your personal information, but are providing this notice to you to ensure that you are aware of the incident and so that
you may take steps to monitor your identity, and your credit accounts, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

On January 11, 2013, the laptop of a Finish Line employee was stolen from the employee’s secured personal vehicle. Upon discovering
the theft, it was reported to local law enforcement. Finish Line commenced an internal investigation into the incident to determine what
data was stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. Finish Line retained independent, third-party forensic experts Navigant Consulting,
Inc. (“Navigant”) to assist with this investigation. Navigant concluded its investigation on February 17, 2013. At that time, Navigant
determined that a file containing your Social Security number, and name, as well as other information relating to your employment, was
stored on the laptop at the time of the theft.

Finish Line takes this matter, and the security of your personal information, seriously. Upon discovering the theft, and in addition to
launching its own internal investigation and retaining Navigant to perform an independent forensic investigation, Finish Line retained
privacy and data security legal counsel to assist with this investigation of, and response to, the theft. The theft was reported to local law
enforcement. Law enforcement’s investigation into the theft is ongoing.




                                                                                                                                                   68397003002000000010101
Finish Line is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information, and it does not appear that the personal
information stored on the laptop was the target of the theft. Out of an abundance of caution, though, Finish Line retained Experian to
provide —at no cost to you—a membership for up to one (1) year to its ProtectMyID™ Alert identity monitoring and identity recovery
services. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection
services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. Follow the instructions below to enroll and receive these

To further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account
statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually
from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free,
1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert’ on your file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify
your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect
you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your
fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any
questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.
