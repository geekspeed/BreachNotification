350 Parnassus Avenue, # 607	   I am writing to inform you of an incident involving some of your health information. On
San Francisco, CA 94143-0354   September 10, 2013, UCSF learned that an unencrypted laptop was stolen from the locked
www.ucsfhealth.org             vehicle of a UCSF Liver Transplant employee on September 9, 2013. UCSF immediately
                               began an extensive technical analysis to determine what information was on the laptop. On
University of California       September 25, 2013, UCSF determined that the laptop housed files containing your name,
                               medical record number, and some health information. The files may have also contained
San Francisco                  other identifiable information, such as your date of birth or email address. The files did not
                               contain your social security number.

                               At this time, there is no evidence that there has been any attempted access or attempted use
                               of the information included in this incident; however, we are bringing this to your attention
                               as a precautionary measure. You may wish to monitor for signs of possible misuse of your
                               personal information or identity, including closely reviewing any “Explanation of Benefits”
                               sent by your health insurer. If there are payments you do not recognize, you should follow
                               up with the insurer or provider.

                               Additional information about identify theft may be obtained from the following agencies:

                                   •	   California Office of the Attorney General

                               Please note that if an unknown person should contact you to confirm any of your personal
                               information, do not provide any details, as the University will not contact you again in re-
                               lation to this incident.

                               The University of California is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal informa-
                               tion and takes many precautions to secure that information. In response, we have reviewed

                               as a precautionary measure. You may wish to take the following steps to ensure the protec-
                               tion of your personal information:

                                   1.	 Place a free fraud alert on your credit file to let creditors know to contact you be-
                                       fore opening a new account in your name. Simply call any one of the three credit
                                       reporting agencies at the phone numbers listed below to (a) request that a fraud
                                       alert be placed on your credit file and (b) order a free credit report from the agency.

                                   	    •	 Equifax (800) 525-6285
                                   	    •	 Experian (888) 397-3742
                                   	    •	 TransUnion (800) 680-7289

                                   2.	 When you receive your credit reports, look them over carefully for accounts you
                                       did not open or for inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate. Review your
                                       personal information, such as home address and social security number, for ac-
                                       curacy. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency at the
                                       telephone number on the report.

                                   3.	 If you find any suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police
                                       station or sheriff’s office.

                                   4.	 Closely monitor any “Explanation of Benefits” sent by your health insurer. If there
                                       are payments you do not recognize, follow-up with the insurer or provider.
