SUBJECT: IMPORTANT – Notification of Data Security Breach

Dear Patient,
On the afternoon of Saturday , September 15th 2012, we discovered our office suite broken into and our
computer stolen. The computer stored both medical records and insurance information, including social
security numbers of several patients, including yours. As a result, your personal information is now
potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.

Immediately upon discovery, we contacted local authorities and reported the break-in. You may contact
the Fresno Police Department and reference case number 12-67356 if you have any questions.

We encourage you take the following steps to protect yourself from risks associated with this breach of
your data:


  Medical Records and Health Insurance Information : Regularly review the explanation of benefits
   statement that you receive from your insurance administrator. If you see any services listed that
   you did not receive, contact your administrator immediately at the number on your statement.
   You should also check your credit reports for medical bills that you do not recognize. If you find
   anything suspicious, call the credit reporting agency on the number on the report.
  Social Security Number: Place a fraud alert on your credit files. A fraud alert requires potential
   creditors to use what the law refers to as “reasonable policies and procedures” to verify your
   identity before issuing credit in your name. The alert will remain on your accounts for 90 days. You
   can request a fraud alert through any one of the three credit reporting agencies: Experian
   (888)397-3742; Equifax (800)525-6285: TransUnion (800)680-7289. You can also request copies of
   your credit report from any of these agencies, which you should check for suspicious activity. If
   you find anything, contact local authorities and file a report of identity theft. Ask for a copy of the
   police report, as you may need to supply this to your creditors.
  Financial Account Numbers: No bank or credit card information was compromised. This
   information is not stored on our computer.


If there is anything that Dr. Corneliuson can do to assist you, please contact us at 559-261-0185 or via

Sincerely,
