        RE: Important Security and Protection Notification
            Please read this entire letter
Dear Sample A Sample:
We regret to inform you that Kellogg & Andelson Global Management (K&A) recently was the victim of a
criminal attack on its computer network. We are sending you this letter because, unfortunately, some of the
personal information you have shared with us may have been accessed during that criminal attack. In late
February, K&A noticed suspicious activity involving a handful of client accounts. K&A immediately retained a
private forensic investigator, who discovered on March 4, 2015 that K&A had suffered a criminal cyber-attack.
K&A has been working closely with law enforcement to apprehend the criminal. We believe the intruder began
periodically accessing the K&A network late last year and did so until late February. Since that time, we have
taken steps to exclude the criminal from the K&A environment. We are working to prevent such an event from
occurring again by hardening the K&A network to further protect information you have entrusted to us.
Depending on the type of information you have provided to us about yourself (or other family members), your (or
your family members) name, home address, date of birth, Social Security Number, financial account numbers,
and possibly other information you have provided to K&A may have been exposed. We found no specific proof
that your personal data was stolen by the attacker, but, to be cautious, we determined that notifying you and
providing you with identity theft protection was the right thing to do.
To help protect your identity, we have engaged Experian®, the largest credit bureau in the US, to offer you Fraud

                                 YOUR CHANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT
Information about reporting and preventing identity theft can be found at
http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/protecting-your-identity?sort=popular.
A fraud alert is a statement added to your credit report that alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within
your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. A security
freeze is a statement added to your credit report that alerts creditors not to open accounts under your name. In
general, to request a security freeze you must contact the three national Credit Reporting Agencies either via
telephone, through their websites, or by writing to them. In order to place a security freeze, you may be asked to
provide them with some or all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) Social Security Number; (3)
date of birth; (4) any prior addresses for the last five years; (5) proof of current address; (6) a photocopy of a
government issued ID card; (7) if you are the victim of identity theft, a copy of a police or investigative report or
complaint to law enforcement concerning the theft; (8) if you are not a victim of identity theft, payment by check,
money order, or credit card.
If you have been a victim of identity theft and provide a Credit Reporting Agency with a valid police report, they
will not charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In other cases, a credit reporting agency may charge
a small fee (typically no more than $10, although the fee varies by state; in Massachusetts, the fee is $5) to place,
lift or remove a security freeze.
The following is the contact information for the three national Credit Reporting Agencies:

Additionally, if you believe that you have been the victim of identity theft, you have the right to file a police

to police and the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC can be reached at 1-877-438-4338, or Federal Trade
Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580, or online
