Dear FirstName LastName,

We are contacting you because of a security incident involving your personal
information.

On June 19, 2013, dental records were reported missing from a California
Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) staff memberâ€™s possession while off the
premises of a correctional institution. The missing documents contained information
such as patient name, CDCR number, date of birth, and dental treatment plan. It is
possible that your dental record may have been included in the missing documents.
CCHCS has conducted an investigation of this incident and is taking steps to locate
the missing documents.

We regret this incident occurred and want to assure you CCHCS has taken steps to
mitigate these types of events, including information security training for staff
associated with this event. We do not believe there are any further protective
measures you need to take at this time. If you have further inquiries please contact
the Controlled Correspondence Unit, PO Box 588500, Sacramento, CA 95758-8500.
