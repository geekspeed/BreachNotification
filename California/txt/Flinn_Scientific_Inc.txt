RE: IMPORTANT notice about your personal information. Please read this entire letter.

Dear John Q Sample,

On September 8, 2014, we discovered that a cyber-attacker used malware to gain access to our
server that hosts our internet store. The attacker managed to intercept payment card information
for those cards that our customers used to make purchases on our website between the dates of
May 2, 2014 and September 8, 2014. We write today because our records indicate that you made
one or more purchases on our website during this time frame. The information intercepted by the
attacker includes your payment card number, card verification code, expiration date, name,
address, and email address.

Upon discovering the attack, we immediately took steps to eliminate the malware and block any
further unauthorized access to our servers. We have been carefully monitoring our systems and
confirmed that there has been no further unauthorized access to our customer’s data since
September 8. We also have implemented additional security measures designed to specifically
counter how the attacker managed to gain access to our web server to ensure this will not happen
again.
