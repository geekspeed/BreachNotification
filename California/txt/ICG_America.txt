Dear <salutation><name>,

ICG America, which operates a family of companies that includes Amazing Clubs, Flying
Noodle, MonsterBrew, and California Reds, is committed to protecting your personal
information. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that
information.

ICG America was advised by a credit card company on August 5, 2013 that we may have been
the target of a cyber-attack against our payment processing system. We immediately engaged a
leading computer security firm to investigate. The security firm found signs of an attack that
began on January 2, 2013 and continued until August 2, 2013. The attacker installed a program
on our network that created the ability to decrypt and capture payment card information from our
system.

Because of the nature of the program used by the attacker, the investigation could not determine
whether the attacker actually viewed or removed any information from any system.
Accordingly, we wanted to notify everyone whose information could have been accessed. This
information may include your name, address, e-mail address, credit or debit card account
number, expiration date, and card verification value. If you see a fraudulent charge on your card,
you should immediately contact the bank that issued your card. Major credit card companies
typically guarantee cardholders will not be responsible for fraudulent charges.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports
for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once
every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your
annual free credit report please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-
8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

   Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
   Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
   TransUnion, PO Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834, www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal
information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission
and/or the attorney generalâ€™s office in your home state. Contact information for the Federal
Trade Commission is as follows:
  Federal Trade Commission
  600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20580
  www.ftc.gov
  1-877-438-4338

You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid
identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also
contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the
police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

We want to assure you that we are committed to the security of your personal information and
are taking this matter seriously. We have conducted an internal review of our practices and
procedures and are updating our system protections. If you have any questions, or you need
further assistance, you may contact us at 866-264-1050, Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM until
7:00 PM, Eastern Time.
