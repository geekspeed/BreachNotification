Dear Sample A Sample:

Over the summer, Harbor Freight Tools' payment processing system was illegally attacked by cyber-criminals.
The attack was similar to attacks reported by other national retailers. In response, we immediately engaged a
leading cyber-security company to investigate and notices were posted in every store and on our website. We
blocked the attack and adopted enhanced security measures to make our systems more secure than ever.

Fortunately, this incident was limited to credit and debit card transactions made in our stores during a relatively
short seven week period (May 6, 2013 to June 30, 2013). Transactions after June 30, 2013 were not affected.
For nearly all of these transactions, we believe that the attacker only found "track 2" data— information on the
card's magnetic stripe that contains only the card account number, expiration date, and card verification
number. For less than 1% of these transactions, the attacker may have found data that also included the
cardholder’s name.

Because we cannot identify which specific cards or information were actually taken, we are notifying our
customers that we have been able to identify whose cards were used during the May 6, 2013 to June 30, 2013
time frame at each impacted store. We believe your card was in this group.

If you see a fraudulent charge on your card, please immediately contact the bank that issued your card. Major
credit card companies typically guarantee cardholders will not be responsible for fraudulent charges. Please be
on the lookout and review your account statements for any unauthorized activity. We have included additional
information about ways you can protect yourself on the back of this letter.

We regret any inconvenience this may cause. Keeping customer information secure is a top priority at Harbor
Freight and we will continue to work to make our network more secure. If you have questions, please call us toll
free at 877-216-4023, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. –7 p.m. EST, and use the following ten digit reference
number when calling: 4471100813.

Sincerely,


Eric Smidt
President, Harbor Freight Tools
