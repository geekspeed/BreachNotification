Dear<<Name>>:
Point Loma Nazarene University (the “University”) is writing to inform you of a data incident that may affect the
security of your personal information. There is currently no evidence that your information was viewed or removed,
and we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information, but we are nevertheless providing
notice of this incident to you so that you may take steps to monitor your identity and accounts should you feel it is
necessary to do so.
What Happened
Between October 7, 2014 and October 20, 2014, the University became aware of and remediated instances of
unauthorized access to five employee email accounts that occurred during this time period as a result of phishing
attacks. Upon learning of this matter, we immediately launched an investigation and retained outside forensic
experts to determine the scope of this incident. While the investigation into the matter is ongoing, the external
forensics experts have confirmed that the following categories of your personal information were potentially subject
to unauthorized access:
         • Name                                       • <<Credit card number and CVV code or expirate date>>
         • Social Security number                     • <<User name and password>>
         • <<Date of birth>>                          • <<Driver’s license number>>

What We Are Doing
The University takes this matter, and the security of the personal information in its care, seriously and has taken
measures to ensure that this type of exposure does not occur again. The University disabled the affected accounts,
changed the passwords, and ensured that they were not used to access any portions of the University’s system. The
University has informed individuals who may have been the target of the phishing attack to be on alert and instructed
them to change passwords if phishing links were clicked; has sent educational emails on how to avoid phishing attacks;
has blocked the URL associated with the phishing attack; and has implemented or is in the process of implementing
two-factor authentication for all Point Loma accounts that may handle sensitive information.
Additionally, we are offering you access to a complimentary one-year membership to Experian’s® ProtectMyID® Alert
triple bureau. This service helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior
identity protection support that is focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.

report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major
credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert” on your file that alerts creditors to take
additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency
verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud
alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit
report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below. Information regarding security freezes is also available
from these agencies.
