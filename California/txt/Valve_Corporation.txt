Dear Steam User:

         If you have accessed your Steam account since November 10, 2011 you know that we
had a network intrusion. We learned about this intrusion when the Steam forums were defaced
on November 6. Since then our investigation of this intrusion has continued with the help of
outside security experts. We now have additional information we would like to share with you.
We are providing this information to you in this formal way because it might be required by your
state’s law.

        We’ve recently learned that it is probable that in 2009 the intruders obtained a copy of a
database with information about Steam transactions between 2004 and 2008. This database
contained user names, email addresses, encrypted billing addresses and encrypted credit card
information. We do not have any evidence that the encryption on credit card numbers and
billing addresses has been compromised. We are still investigating and working with the Seattle
FBI office.

        We don’t have evidence of credit card misuse. Nonetheless, you should watch your
credit card activity and statements closely. You can also remain vigilant by monitoring free
credit reports. Visit www.annualcreditreport.com to find out more about obtaining free credit
reports. The FTC provides information about steps you can take to avoid identity theft, and
about obtaining fraud alerts and security freezes—you can learn more by: visiting
www.ftc.gov/idtheft; writing Federal Trade Commission, CRC-240, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20580; or calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357) or 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-
4338). You can also obtain information about obtaining fraud alerts or security freezes from the
three major consumer reporting agencies below:

Experian                      Equifax                        TransUnion
