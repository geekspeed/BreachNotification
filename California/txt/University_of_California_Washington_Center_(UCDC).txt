Subject: Notification of Compromised Course Enrollment System at UCDC



Dear UC Washington Center (UCDC) Alumni

On June 8th, 2014, UCDC received notification of unsolicited emails being sent to UCDC
Alumni. An investigation by UCDC’s tech unit revealed that an unauthorized individual had
gained access to UCDC’s pre-enrollment system hosted at ucdc.gosignmeup.com and the data
stored on this system. GoSignMeUp is a cloud-based provider of an online course registration
system engaged by UCDC to host its course registration system. The data accessed included your
password and user name. Your account on this system and related UCDC systems has since been
deactivated. Other information including your address and principal e-mail at the time of your
participation in UCDC as well as your gender, birth date and UCDC courses may have been
compromised. By policy UCDC does not record user social security numbers or financial
account information in any of its databases.

If you are using the ucdc.gosignmeup.com password with any other accounts (bank, credit card,
social networking sites, etc.), you should change that password immediately. Never use a
password that someone else knows again (ever).

UCDC is committed to maintaining the security of its online accounts and takes many
precautions to protect its electronic systems and information. We are working with the vendor of
this service to find additional ways to increase the security of UCDC user data stored on this
system. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident presents to you.

If you have any questions, please contact techhelp@ucdc.edu.
