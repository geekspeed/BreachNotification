Dear <<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>>,
We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have resulted in the disclosure of your personal
information, including your name, driver’s license number, and credit card number. Your Social Security number is not
in our system and was not exposed. We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and sincerely
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains information about steps you can take to
protect your information, and resources we are making available to help you.
What happened and what information was involved:
On December 16, 2015, we discovered that an agent’s Baja Bound Insurance Service’s email account may have been
compromised through a phishing attack. From our investigation, it appears the phishing email was intended to collect
only email addresses. As part of our investigation, we also reviewed the documents stored in the email account and
discovered an application that contained your personal information, including your name, address, date of birth,
driver’s license number, and credit card number. Our website, www.bajabound.com, was not affected and remains
secure. While we have no evidence that any of this information was viewed or compromised, we wanted to let you
know about this event out of an abundance of caution.
What we are doing and what can you do:
Although we do not believe there is a risk of identity theft, as an added precaution, we are providing you with one year
of identity monitoring at no cost to you through Kroll. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring and
Identity Theft Consultation and Restoration. Additional information describing your services is included with this letter.

For residents of Massachusetts:
It is required by state law that you are informed of your right to obtain a police report if you are a victim of identity theft.
For residents of all states:
Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also
via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they
open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may
delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three credit bureaus is below:
Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.
Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent
credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit
report, you need to send a request to each consumer reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail.
The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for
your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social
Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable
incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a
copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential
that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. The consumer reporting agency
may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, but is free if you are a victim of identity theft or the
spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the
consumer reporting agency. You may obtain a security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer
reporting agencies:
Equifax Security Freeze	              Experian Security Freeze	      TransUnion (FVAD)
P.O. Box 105788	                      P.O. Box 9554	                 P.O. Box 2000
