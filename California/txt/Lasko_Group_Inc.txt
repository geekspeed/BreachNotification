Dear Sample Sample:
We are writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of your personal information. We
are providing this notice to ensure that you are aware of the incident and so that you may take steps to
monitor your identity, financial accounts, and any existing credit file should you feel it is appropriate to do
so.
On July 2, 2014, Lasko Group, Inc. became aware of the fact that certain customers who made recent
on-line parts purchases from Lasko Products, Inc. (Lasko) and Air King America, Inc. (Air King) were
the targets of fraudulent phishing emails from an unknown third party purporting to relate to these orders.
Upon learning of this, Lasko and Air King immediately launched an internal investigation into this
incident. This investigation revealed that these fraudulent emails could be related to unauthorized hacking
activity into our computer network. Lasko and Air King retained external, nationally recognized computer
forensics experts to confirm these findings and to identify the full extent of data potentially exposed as a
result of this incident. While the investigation is ongoing, we have determined that a file containing your
name, email address, phone number, credit card number, and credit card expiration date was potentially
accessible to the hacker. Although most of the activity associated with this unauthorized hacking into our
computer network appears to have occurred during March-June 2014, we can not rule out the possibility of
unauthorized access to our network leading to the exposure of credit card information dating back to
December 2011. Other personal information such as Social Security number, credit card security number,
drivers license number, or date of birth was not collected as part of your transaction with Lasko or Air
King and therefore was not accessible to the third-party hackers.
Lasko and Air King take this matter, and the security of personal information entrusted to it, seriously. Out
of an abundance of caution, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect your identity for one year at no
cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the date of this notice and you can use them
at any time during the next 12 months.

                                                                                                                  A2294-L02

To further protect against possible identity theft, fraud or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain
vigilant, to review your account statements, to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity, and to
only respond to emails from a known/authenticated sender. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one (1) free
credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit
report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, (877) 322-8228. You may also contact the three
major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your file that alerts creditors
to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that
because a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your
ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your
fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert,
or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed
below. Information regarding security freezes is also available from these agencies.

Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to
file a complaint with them, and information regarding fraud alerts and security freezes may also be
obtained from the Federal Trade Commission. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also
be reported to law enforcement and/or your states Attorney General.
