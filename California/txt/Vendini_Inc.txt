                      IMPORTANT INFORMATION. PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY.
May 22, 2013

Dear Patron:

We regret to inform you that on April 25, 2013, Vendini, Inc. detected an unauthorized intrusion into
its systems. Vendini provides box-office and online ticketing services to hundreds of entertainment
venues, which include tour, casino, sports, and arts organizations across the U.S. and Canada. Based
on our records, you used a credit card to make a purchase for an event that was processed through
Vendini’s service, and your information may have been involved in this incident.

We are actively cooperating with federal law enforcement, and this notification to you was delayed
specifically to support law enforcement’s investigation. In addition, a full-scale, internal investigation
is under way at Vendini with outside computer forensic and cyber security experts. Although our
internal investigation is ongoing, we believe that in late March, a third-party criminal actor used hacking
technologies to access our databases and may have accessed your personal information, such as name,
mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card numbers and expiration dates. We do
not collect credit card security access codes (e.g., CVV, CVV2, PINs), social security numbers, usernames
or passwords.

Upon discovering this intrusion, we engaged computer forensic and cyber security experts to commence
an investigation. We implemented enhanced security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of this
type of incident. We notified our merchant banks; and credit card companies have been alerted.

In addition, please note the following:

    ●   To protect against the possibility of identity theft or fraud, we urge you to remain vigilant, and
        to regularly review your credit card account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized
        activity.
    ●   If you suspect that you may be a victim of identity theft or fraud, immediately contact your
        local law enforcement agency, your State Attorney General’s office and the Federal Trade
        Commission. We have enclosed a Resources Guide for your reference.
    ●   Do NOT respond to any requests for sensitive personal information in relation to this incident.
        Vendini will never request such information via email or telephone unless it is absolutely
        necessary to respond directly to you regarding how this incident may impact you.

We sincerely regret this incident. Protecting data privacy and security is a top priority for our company.
For more information regarding this incident, please contact us toll-free at 1-800-836-0473 or visit us at

Sincerely,


Mark Tacchi
President and CEO

“Fraud Alerts” and “Security Freezes”

  Fraud Alert - You have the right to place a fraud alert in your file to alert potential creditors that you may be
  a victim of identity theft. Creditors must then follow certain procedures to protect you; therefore, a fraud
  alert may delay your ability to obtain credit. An “initial fraud alert” stays in your file for at least 90 days. An
  “extended fraud alert” stays in your file for 7 years, and will require an identity theft report (usually, a filed police
  report). You may place a fraud alert by calling any one of the three national consumer reporting agencies:
    Equifax: 1-800-525-6285            Experian: 1-888-397-3742             TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289

  Security Freeze – Some U.S. states provide the right to place a security freeze on your credit file, which prevents
  credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. Using a freeze may
  interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. To place a freeze, send a request by mail to each consumer
  reporting agency (addresses below) with the following (if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this
  information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) Full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social
  Security Number; (3) Date of Birth; (4) Current address and any previous addresses for the past two years; and
  (5) Any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
  You must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank
  or insurance statement. Each copy must be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date
  of issue. The credit reporting agency may charge a fee up to $5.00 to place, lift, and/or remove a freeze, unless
  you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police
  report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agency.
