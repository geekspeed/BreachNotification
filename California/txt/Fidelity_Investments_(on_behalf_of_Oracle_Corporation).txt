Dear Current or Former Oracle Employee:

We are writing to notify you of a matter that involved some information about you held by
Fidelity Investments, a retirement plan administrative service provider for Oracle
Corporation.

On July 10, 2013, information about you was inadvertently included in a report that was
briefly viewed by a plan administrator at another Fidelity client firm. The report included
your name, Social Security number, compensation, and other information related to
administration of your 401(k) savings and investment plan. The report that contained this
information was only accessible through a password-protected application and only one
employee at the Fidelity client firm had access to this report, a Human Resources manager,
who is authorized to handle personal data related to his firm’s benefits plans as part of his
job responsibilities. That employee fully and promptly cooperated with Fidelity in the
return and deletion of the report. While we are not aware of any misuse of this information
nor do we expect any, it is always a good idea to remain vigilant and regularly review your
account statements, monitor your credit reports, and promptly report any activity of
concern.

Fidelity became aware of this matter on July 10, 2013, and immediately deleted the report
from the password-protected application. Please know that we take the protection of your
information very seriously and have taken steps to further strengthen our administrative
control procedures to help prevent a recurrence.

We sincerely apologize for any concern of inconvenience this matter may cause you. If you have
any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to call Fidelity at 1-800-410-2363.

Sincerely,




William Duserick
Chief Privacy Officer

Directions for Placing a Fraud Alert
You may want to consider placing an initial fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells
creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.
You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide credit reporting
agencies. The agency that processes your fraud alert will notify the other two credit reporting
agencies on your behalf. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for 90 days. When you
place this alert on your credit report, you will receive information about ordering one free credit
report from each of the credit reporting companies. Once you receive your reports, review them
carefully for inquiries from companies you did not contact, accounts you did not open, and debts
on your accounts that you cannot explain. Verify the accuracy of your Social Security number,
address(es), full name and employer(s). Notify the credit reporting companies if any information
is incorrect.

You may also contact the three nationwide credit reporting agencies to place as security freeze
on your credit report. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any
information from a consumer’s credit report without written authorization. However, please be
aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the
timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing
or other services.

account statements and your credit report for incidents of fraud and identity theft. Report
suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to your state attorney general.
