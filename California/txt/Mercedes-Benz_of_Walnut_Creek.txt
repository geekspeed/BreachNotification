Dear Sample A. Sample:

I am contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred at Mercedes-Benz of Walnut Creek. On
Friday, February 8, 2013, around 7:00 am we discovered a forcible break-in at Mercedes-Benz of Walnut Creek’s

thief or thieves pried open a locked exterior door to the dealership, another locked interior door into the Business
Office was pried open, and once inside the Business Office, locked file cabinets containing customer deal jackets
were pried open and some customer deal files were removed. Additionally, some files containing customer
personal information were removed from our Service Department. We immediately reported this incident to the
Walnut Creek Police Department, who immediately commenced an investigation into this criminal activity. The
name of the investigating officer who is leading the criminal investigation is Detective Sam Vesser with the
Walnut Creek Police Department. Please refer to Case Number 13-4022 and the phone number for the Walnut
