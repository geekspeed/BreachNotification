Dear <Member Name>:

We are sending you this letter to inform you of an information processing error that may have
involved accidental disclosure of your information. On January 24, 2014, we became aware that
some L.A. Care Covered members who logged onto our payment portal were able to see another
member’s name, address and member identification number.

Upon learning of this issue we temporarily disabled the payment portal and promptly began to
investigate the issue. We were able to confirm that the disclosures took place between January
22, 2014 to January 24, 2014 and were the result of a manual information processing error which
we have since corrected. We were also able to confirm that the information disclosed was
limited to member name, address and member identification number and did not include any
other information, such as Social Security number, Driver’s License number, or financial
account numbers.

Although we have no indication that your information was misused, we will be sending you a
new member identification number and new card with the replacement identification number.

Please keep a copy of this notice for your records. For information about your medical privacy
rights, we recommend you visit the website of the California Department of Justice, Privacy
Enforcement and Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov.

Your privacy is very important to us. We regret that this incident occurred and want to assure
you that we are reviewing and revising our procedures and practices to minimize the risk of this
happening again. Should you need any further information about this incident, please contact
L.A. Care’s Privacy Officer at PrivacyOfficer@lacare.org, by telephone at 1-855-270-2327, or
letter to 1055 West 7th Street, 10th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90017.

We will be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have.

Sincerely,


Veronica Richardson
Privacy & Information Security Officer
