Dear Consumer:

You are a valued customer of JB Autosports, Inc., which is why you are receiving this notice about a security
breach at http://subispeed.com and http://ft86speedfactory.com (“the websites”) that may have affected your
personal information.

From approximately August 1, 2015 through November 9, 2015, the websites’ checkout page where customers
input their payment information to purchase products from JB Autosports was the target of a cyberattack
originating from a Russian IP address. The breach affected customers who used Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
and American Express branded cards to pay for their purchases from the websites. The breach allowed
cyberattackers to intercept customer names, addresses, credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, CID
numbers, CAV2 numbers, CVC2 numbers, and CVV2 numbers (“Customer Information”). The Customer
Information was intercepted after it was entered on the checkout page as it was being transmitted to PayPal for
processing. JB Autosports’ policy is to not store customer credit card information.

Since detecting the breach, JB Autosports has made every effort to mitigate the damage by contracting with a
third-party vendor to identify the source of the breach and implement security solutions to prevent a recurrence
of the breach. JB Autosports has also improved its cybersecurity defenses to prevent future breaches of
Customer Information. In addition, JB Autosports has had major credit card networks and PayPal notified of the
breach. No law enforcement investigation delayed this notice.

Nevertheless, as a result of the data breach you may become the target of identity theft, including credit and
debit card fraud. Cyberattackers may have already tried to commit fraud using your Customer Information, or
they may be waiting to do so in the future. You should monitor your credit and account statements to ensure
that you are not the victim of fraudulent activity. You may want to contact your financial institution to discuss
fraud prevention programs that might be available to you.

You may also obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies
once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by
completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service,
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You should also be aware that you can obtain information about your
credit report and ways to detect fraudulent activity by contacting each of the national consumer reporting
agencies:

You may obtain information from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion on how to place a security freeze on your
credit report. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a
consumer’s credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze
on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new
loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or other services. You may find information about how to place a
security freeze on your credit report by visiting the following websites for each of the credit reporting agencies:

Equifax: https://www.freeze.equifax.com/
Experian: https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html
Transunion: http://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze
