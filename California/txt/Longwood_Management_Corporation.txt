Dear Sample A Sample:
Longwood Management (Longwood) is writing to provide notice of a recent incident that may affect the
security of your personally identifiable information. Longwood is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of
your information, but is providing notice of this incident to you so that you may take steps to protect against
identity theft and fraud should you feel it is appropriate to do so.
What happened? On February 11, 2015, a Longwood employees vehicle was burglarized. During the burglary,
a password-protected laptop we issued to this employee was stolen. The employee immediately reported the
burglary to local law enforcement and to Longwood. Longwood immediately launched an investigation into the
incident, including both the security of the laptop and the type of information that may have been stored on or
accessible by the laptop, at the time of the theft. We retained independent, third-party forensic investigators to
assist in our investigation into this incident. Their investigation, and the investigation of law enforcement, is
ongoing. On April 28, 2015, we learned that encryption software was deployed on the laptop at the time of the
theft, but that the encryption may not have been sufficient to prevent access by someone with the knowledge
or skills to exploit vulnerabilities. Through our ongoing investigation, we identified a file containing your name,
Social Security number, position, and facility location was stored locally on the laptop at the time of the theft.
What we are doing.      We continue to investigate this incident, and will continue to cooperate with law
enforcements investigation into this incident. We are reviewing our policies and procedures regarding the
storage of personal information and security of mobile devices. We are reporting this incident to certain state
regulators. We are also providing notice of this incident to you, and offering you access to a complimentary
one-year membership to Experians ProtectMyID Elite credit monitoring and identity restoration product.
Instructions on how to enroll and receive these services are included in the attached Notice of Privacy
Safeguards.
What you can do. You can review the enclosed Notice of Privacy Safeguards, which includes helpful information
on protecting against identity theft and fraud. You can also enroll to receive the free year of credit monitoring      0123456


and identity restoration services we are offering to you. Should you have any questions about the contents of
this letter, enrollment in the Experian product, or ways you can protect yourself from identity theft or fraud,
please call our confidential privacy line between 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. P.S.T. (Closed on U.S. observed
holidays.), Monday through Friday, at (877)215-8731. Please use reference number 2423042915 when calling.

                                                                 (OVER PLEASE)
                                                                                                                      B0019-L01
The security of information in our care is of the utmost concern to us, and we are very sorry for any
inconvenience and concern this incident may cause you.
Sincerely,




Patrice Seyler
Director of Human Resources,
Longwood Management Corp.

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your file that alerts creditors to
take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because
it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while
the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified
to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions
regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed above.
You can also further educate yourself regarding identity theft, and the steps you can take to protect yourself, by
contacting your state Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission. For North Carolina residents can be
contacted at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, (919) 716-6400, www.ncdoj.gov. For Maryland

743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their
information has been misused to file a complaint with them. The Federal Trade Commission can be reached at
