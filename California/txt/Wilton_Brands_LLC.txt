Important Security and Protection Notification.
Please read this entire letter.

Dear Sample A. Sample:
We are writing to inform you of a potential security incident involving personal information maintained
by Wilton Brands LLC (“Wilton”). While we currently have no evidence that your personal information
was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice and outlining some steps you
may take to help protect yourself. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may
cause you.
On or about October 31, 2012 a service provider of Wilton discovered that a malicious user had added a
file to a computer server that hosts www.wilton.com and www.copco.com. During the period of July
19, 2012-October 2, 2012 this activity resulted in the malicious user being able to view some
Wilton/Copco user information, including name, address, city, state, telephone, and payment card
information, including card number, expiration date and security codes (e.g. CVV2/CVC2/CID). We
believe that your personal information could have been accessed as a result of this incident.
Wilton takes the privacy of personal information seriously. Wilton took steps to address and contain the
incident the same day it was discovered. Wilton also promptly engaged a computer forensic investigator
to perform an investigation, and self-reported the incident by notifying its merchant bank. We also
notified law enforcement of this incident and intend to assist their efforts in prosecuting the criminals who
accessed our systems.
In addition, we have already taken measures designed to prevent this from happening again in the future.
On October 2, 2012, unrelated and prior to the identification of the incident, Wilton changed its payment
processing system and is no longer storing full card numbers, expiration dates or security codes on the
computer server that hosts www.wilton.com and www.copco.com.
We want to make you aware of steps you can take to guard against identity theft or fraud. At this time,
we recommend that you review your credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible in order
to determine if there are any discrepancies or unusual activity listed. You should continue to monitor
                                                                                                                            63453004001000000010102




your statements for unusual activity going forward. If you see anything you do not understand or that
looks suspicious, or if you suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, call the bank that
issued your credit or debit card immediately.



                                                                                                                ;NSQHLXc+
                                                                                                                3Ql?C3v`b$'V
                                                                                                                a!a!aa!!a!!aa!a!




                                                                                            63453004-001-000000001
We also recommend you carefully check your credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries
from creditors you did not initiate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency
immediately. If you find any suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriff's
office. Also, please review the enclosed “Information about Identity Theft Protection” reference guide
that describes additional steps you may take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the
Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection, and details on how to place a fraud alert or
a security freeze on your credit file.
In addition, Wilton has arranged for you to be eligible to receive a complimentary one-year membership

When you receive your credit reports, look them over carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
Look for inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate. And look for personal information, such as
home address, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency at
the telephone number on the report. If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your
local police or sheriff’s office and file a police report of identity theft. Get a copy of the police report.
You may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records.

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you
should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law
enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state’s attorney general, and/or the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”).

You may contact the FTC or your state’s regulatory authority to obtain additional information about
avoiding and protection against identity theft.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put
your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You
may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are
about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days.
You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity
theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for
seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national
credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed below:

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your
credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is
issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors
from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors
and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the
freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may
incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The
cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20
per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit
freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a
credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as
specified below to find out more information.
