Re: Reeve-Woods Eye Center Data Breach

Dear Patient or Patient’s Personal Representative,

I am writing on behalf of Reeve-Woods Eye Center (the “Eye Center”), which is an eye clinic with two
facilities: (1) 460 W. East Avenue, Suite 110, Chico, California 95926; and (2) 6009 Pentz Road,
Paradise, California 95969. We recently discovered a security breach of the Eye Center’s computer
systems that may have compromised the privacy of patients’ personal health information. We are sending
this letter to you to notify you of a possible breach of your personal information as part of our
commitment to patient privacy.

On September 17, 2014, our information technology consultant discovered that unknown individuals had
breached the Eye Center’s server and installed malware on two computers, one at each facility. The
malware was capturing screenshots (i.e., a copy or image of what is seen on a computer screen at a given
time) which included patients’ protected health information. We suspect the malware may have been
installed in or around August 2014. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the types of information
about patients that may have been accessed: name; social security number; date of birth; home address;
phone numbers; dates of service; Medi-Cal ID number, Medicare ID number, and/or other insurance
information; information regarding Medi-Cal appeals; diagnosis codes; treatment information; and
medical history.

As of the date of this notice, we have not seen any evidence that shows patients’ information was actually
viewed or otherwise utilized by a third party. Our investigation, however, is ongoing, and we may
uncover evidence your personal information was inappropriately accessed. We are alerting all of our
current and former patients about the security breach and ongoing investigation. In addition to
heightening our computer system’s security, we have ensured that the malware was removed from our
computers and will be providing additional training to our staff concerning the protection of patient
information. We have not yet identified the individuals responsible for this, but we have notified federal
law enforcement and are taking further steps to avoid any future breaches of our computer systems.

We recommend you also consider several steps in order to protect yourself from potential misuse of the
information:
1. Place a fraud alert on your credit files to help protect against the possibility of credit accounts being
    opened in your name. By calling any of the three nationwide credit reporting bureaus listed below,
    you will be able to use an automated telephone system to file a fraud alert at all three bureaus. A fraud

    alert notifies any creditors that access your credit report that you may be the victim of fraud so that
    they might take appropriate action. The numbers are:
               Experian                       Equifax                 TransUnion

2. Obtain a free credit report from each of the bureaus listed above by calling 1-877-322-8228 or by
    logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. You can use the credit reports to identify suspicious
    activity in order to notify the bureaus of such activity.
3. Closely monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unauthorized activity, you should
    promptly contact the institution that opened the account. You can also file a complaint with your local
    police and with the Federal Trade Commission by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338) or
    online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/.

information remains private and is treated with the utmost respect. If you have any questions whatsoever,
