Steps to Protect Your Identity

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements
and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect
fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to
protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC’s Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft,
or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center,
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover
information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting
agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free
copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may
obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228.

You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

       Equifax (800) 525-6285 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 www.equifax.com

       Experian (888) 397-3742 P.O. Box 4500 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com

       TransUnion (800) 680-7289 Fraud Victim Assistance Division P.O. Box 6790 Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
        www.transunion.com

In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and
security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud
alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain
procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file
by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes
your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition,
you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on
your credit report to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your
prior written authorization.
