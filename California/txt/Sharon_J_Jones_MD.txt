                               Important Security and Protection Notification


To past and current patients of Sharon J. Jones, M.D.:


On the evening of March 20, 2015, our office was broken into and approximately 17 patient charts were
stolen along with one desktop computer, two laptops and our server. Upon discovery the following
morning, the San Pablo Police Department was immediately notified and a formal police report was filed.
I then hired a security guard who thwarted another attempted break in 3 days later. We have new
security measures in place, and I will be moving the practice location to 2970 Hilltop Mall Road #300,
Richmond CA 94806 in the next 6 months.

Pertinently, the password protected computers contained a list of all of the patients affected by our
January break-in and their addresses. Further, it included a copy of the letters I have written either to a
patient, or on his/her behalf since 2007. Thus, if I have prepared a letter for you or on your requested
behalf (e.g., for housing), it was potentially breached on the password protected computers. Specifically,
the letters contained a patientâ€™s: first and last name, address, date of birth, and basic medical information
regarding the purpose of the letter. Significantly, the letters did not contain social security numbers nor
financial information.

Though it is not believed that the letters contained social security numbers nor financial information, you
can call the three major credit agencies and place a 90-day fraud alert. These are: Equifax (1-888-766-
0008; P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374), Experian (1-888-397-3742; P.O. Box 4500, Allen, TX 75013),
and TransUnion (800-680-7289; P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000). You are also entitled to a free
credit report every year from each of these agencies at www.annualcreditreport.com. Lastly, you may also
want to contact your bank and credit card company and notify them of the situation.

I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and any concern it may cause you. I understand how
important confidentiality and trust is to our physician-patient relationship. Again, please feel free to call
1-877-451-9361 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Central Time) or use the above postal address to discuss any concerns
or questions you may have.
