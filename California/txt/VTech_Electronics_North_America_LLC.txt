Re: Important Security Message for your VTech Learning Lodge Account


Dear Valued Customer,

On November 24 HKT we discovered that an unauthorized party accessed VTech
customer data on our Learning Lodge app store customer database on November 14
HKT. Our records show that you are a customer of the Learning Lodge.

Our customer database contains general user profile information including name,
email address, encrypted password, secret question and answer for password
retrieval, IP address, mailing address and download history.

It is important to note that our customer database does not contain any credit card or
banking information. VTech does not process or store any customer credit card data
on the Learning Lodge website. To complete the payment or check-out process of any
downloads made on the Learning Lodge website, our customers are directed to a
secure, third party payment gateway.

In addition, our customer database does not contain any personal identification data
(such as ID card numbers, Social Security numbers or driving license numbers).

Upon discovering the unauthorized access we immediately conducted a thorough
investigation, which involved a comprehensive check of the affected site and
implementation of measures to defend against any further attacks. Our investigation
continues as we look at additional ways to strengthen our Learning Lodge database
security.

We will contact you again with appropriate further updates. Additionally, updates will
also be posted on our website at http://www.vtech.com/en/media/press-releases.

In the meantime should you have any questions you can email us at
vtechkids@vtechkids.com .


Yours sincerely,



King F. Pang
Group President
VTech Holdings Limited
