                                                                  Experian Activation Code: __________

Dear [Name]:

In March, Stanley Black & Decker sent out notices to certain employees and former employees regarding
the theft of an employee laptop that may have contained their personal information. Unfortunately, due to
a data merge error, some of those notices may not have reached their intended recipients. In addition,
during the course of our efforts to resolve the data merge issues, we determined that additional
information may have been included in files on the laptop that was not reflected in the original notices.

More particularly, on January 28, 2013, the company-issued laptop of an employee in the Finance
department who handled T&E charges was stolen. Through our investigation of the incident, we believe
that information stored on the laptop may have included your name and the account number and routing
number of the account that you have designated as the account to which direct deposits are to be made to
reimburse you for expenses incurred on the Company’s behalf. Information stored on the laptop may also
have included your social security number.

We deeply regret that this incident occurred and take very seriously the security of personal information.
We recommend that you closely monitor your bank statements for the relevant account to identify any
suspicious or unusual activity on your account. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity, you
should immediately report it to your financial institution.

Due to the nature of the information involved, the Company is offering all potentially affected employees
a two year membership in Experian’s ProtectMyID Alert service at no expense to you. This product helps
detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services
focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. Once your ProtectMyID membership
is activated, your credit report will be monitored daily for 50 leading indicators of identity theft. You’ll
receive timely Credit Alerts from ProtectMyID on any key changes in your credit report which could
include new inquiries, new credit accounts, medical collections and changes to public records. If identity
theft is detected, ProtectMyID will assign a dedicated U.S.-based Identity Theft Resolution Agent who
will walk you through the process of fraud resolution from start to finish for seamless service. As an
added protection, you will receive Experian’s ExtendCARETM service, which provides you with the same
high-level of Fraud Resolution support after your ProtectMyID membership has expired.

Should you wish to activate this service, go to the website, www.protectmyid.com/redeem or call 877-
371-7902 and provide the Experian Activation Code included at the top of this letter by July 31, 2013.

Whether or not you activate this service, you should remain vigilant for identity theft and incidents of
fraud, including by regularly reviewing your credit reports. You may contact the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you
can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC’s Web site, at


                                            Page 1 of 3
http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft/, call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338), or write to, Federal Trade
Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain your credit report from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you
discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that
the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal
law, you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three
nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to
www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit
reporting agencies at:

Equifax                          Experian                          TransUnion
(800) 525-6285                   (888) 397-3742                    (800) 680-7289
P.O. Box 740241                  P.O. Box 9532                     Fraud Victim Assistance Division
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241           Allen, TX 75013                   P.O. Box 6790
www.equifax.com                  www.experian.com                  Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                   www.transunion.com.

In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about
fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your
credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name
because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to
obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit
reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other
two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you may also contact the
nationwide credit reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on your credit
report to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without
your prior written authorization.

Please know that we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you. Be assured that
Stanley Black & Decker has safeguards in place to protect the security of employee information. Please
do not hesitate to contact Tamara Candler, Director, North America Shared Services at 317-558-1640 or
call us toll free at 877-795-2356 if you have any questions or concerns.
                                                  Sincerely,
