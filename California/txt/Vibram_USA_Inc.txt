Dear Sample A Sample,

We write to advise you of a potential compromise of personal information that may affect you.

Vibram USA Inc. contracts with a third-party web hosting provider to manage its website:
www.vibramfivefingers.com. Our records show that you made a purchase from this website
during the period of June 6  July 7, 2014. We have been informed that this website was the
victim of a targeted hacking attack potentially causing your credit card number to be
compromised.

We understand that this may pose an inconvenience to you. We sincerely apologize and regret
that this situation has occurred.

Although we are not certain that your credit card number has been used to make any
unauthorized purchases, we wanted to make you aware of the incident and the steps we have
taken to prevent a reoccurrence.

As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we removed the malicious code installed by the
hackers and implemented additional security measures to help prevent any recurrence of the
activity. Second, we will be relocating our website to a new service provider and secure
platform that has increased security measures. We have also notified state regulators and will be
obtaining additional assurances from our technology providers that additional steps will be taken
to avoid future such incidents.

Even though your Social Security Number or date of birth were not compromised as a result of
this incident, as an added precaution we have arranged to have Experian help protect your
identity for one year at no cost to you through their credit monitoring service.                       0123456

                             Information about Identity Theft Prevention



It is recommended that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain

your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies.         You may obtain a

free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free

1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at

www.annualcreditreport.com) to:      Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta,

GA, 30348-5281.     You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of

the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.



Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com

Experian, P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com

TransUnion, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790, 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com



When you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. Look for accounts or creditor inquiries

that you did not initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home address and Social

Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit

reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.



Remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and promptly

report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement

authorities, including local law enforcement, your states attorney general and/or the Federal Trade

Commission (FTC).     You may contact the FTC or your states regulatory authority to obtain

additional information about avoiding identity theft.

For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity

theft from the Maryland Office of the Attorney General:

Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division

200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us



For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding

identity theft from North Carolina Attorney Generals Office:

North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Consumer Protection Division

9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov



Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put

your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud:       an initial alert and an extended alert.
                                                                                                                    0123456
You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been,

or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.   An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at

least 90 days.



You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of

identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof.       An extended fraud alert stays on your credit

report for seven years.   You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud

number of any of the three national credit reporting agencies listed above.




                                                                                                        A2832-L01
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on

your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number

that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze.   A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential

credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze,

potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless

you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain

credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze.   Credit freeze

laws vary from state to state.  The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze

also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.     Unlike a
fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting
company.   Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please

contact the three major credit reporting companies at the numbers above to find out more

information.
