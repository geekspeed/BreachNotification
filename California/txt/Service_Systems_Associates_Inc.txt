         Service Systems Associates, Inc. Victim of Data Security Breach


DENVER – Oct. 13, 2015 – Service Systems Associates, Inc. (SSA) was the victim of a
payment security breach between March 24 and May 20, 2015. The breach occurred in
the company’s point-of-sale systems used by gift shops in several zoos.

The malware that caused the breach was identified and removed, and all visitors should
feel confident using credit or debit cards anywhere in these facilities.

As soon as SSA learned about the attack, it investigated the breach, working alongside
Sikich, an independent forensic investigator accredited by the Payment Card Industry
Security Standards Council. At the same time, SSA also took several steps to improve
its security and prevent future attacks.

The following locations were affected by the breach:
    Dallas Zoo
    Detroit Zoo
    El Paso Zoo
    Fresno Chaffee Zoo
    Herman Park Conservancy
    Honolulu Zoo
    Houston Zoo
    Zoo Miami
    Museum of Science and Industry (Tampa, Florida)
    Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium

Sikich has confirmed that malware has been located and removed from all affected SSA
clients. Neither the malware nor its known artifacts have been found at any other SSA
client locations.

SSA collaborated with affected zoos to alert their patrons and notified the credit card
companies of the situation. Guests who used retail facilities at the affected locations
between March 24 and May 20, 2015, should visit SSA’s website for more information.
To help any guest affected by this data breach, SSA will offer one year of fraud
