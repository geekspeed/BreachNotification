Dear Sample A Sample:


We are writing to notify you that on May 23, 2013, the Alameda County Sheriffs office notified us
that personal information pertaining to a number of people, including you, was recovered during an

The information may have originated from Sutter Healths Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Sutter
Delta Medical Center or Eden Medical Center, and may have included the following: your name,
Social Security number, date of birth, gender, address, zip code, home phone number, marital status,
name of your employer and your work phone number.


We hold your personal information in the highest regard. We are cooperating with law enforcement
and assisting them in their ongoing investigation of this incident. While it is presently unclear where
the information originated, and whether your information has been viewed, we have decided to offer
credit monitoring services because your Social Security number is involved. We are providing you

monitoring capabilities and assistance in identity theft protection. For more information on

Sincerely




President, Sutter Health East Bay Region
