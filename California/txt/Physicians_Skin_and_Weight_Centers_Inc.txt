                           Important Security and Protection Notification


To past and current patients of Physicians Skin & Weight Centers, Inc:

On November 4, 2014, an employee’s vehicle was broken into in Fresno, California and a
password protected laptop and external hard drive were stolen from the vehicle. Fortunately,
the theft was discovered within an hour of its occurrence and the Fresno Police Department was
immediately notified and a formal police report was filed.

Physicians Skin & Weight Centers has security measures in place and we routinely delete
information from electronic devices. However, we believe some patients’ personal information
was on a device at the time of the incident. Specifically, the following information belonging to
some of our patients was potentially exposed: Images taken during the course of their treatment
with their first and/or last name; and some patients’ name on a company invoice. Also, a limited
number of patients had banking information including full routing numbers, account numbers,
and/or credit card numbers;	  and/or a copy of our financing application detailing some patients’
social security number, date of birth, mailing address, email address, income, rent payment, and
employer’s name potentially exposed.

Though there is no evidence that any patients’ information has been used, we are taking this
matter very seriously and are reexamining our practices. To help protect our affected patients,
we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect their identity for 12 months at no cost to the
patients, starting on the date of this notice. Our affected patients can use the services at any time
during the next 12 months.

AllClear SECURE: The team at AllClear ID is ready and standing by if an affected patient needs
help protecting their identity. Affected patients are automatically eligible to use this service – there
is no action required on their part. If a problem arises, call 1-877-437-3998 and an investigator
will verify you were an affected individual, and then do the work to recover financial losses, restore
your credit, and make sure your identity is returned to its proper condition. AllClear ID maintains
an A+ rating at the Better Business Bureau.

AllClear PRO: This service offers additional protection including credit monitoring and a $1 million
identity theft insurance policy. To use the PRO service, an affected patient needs to provide their
personal information to AllClear ID. He/she may sign up by calling 1-877-437-3998, varying that
they were affected and providing the necessary information.

these agencies at www.annualcreditreport.com. Lastly, affected patients may also want to
contact their bank and credit card company and notify them of the situation.
We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and any concern it may cause you. We
