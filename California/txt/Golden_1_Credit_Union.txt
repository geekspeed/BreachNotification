Dear Member,
We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of your personal information. Although we are
not aware of any misuse of your information, we are providing this notice to ensure that you are aware of the incident so that
you may take steps to protect your information should you feel it is appropriate to do so.
We have discovered that a person employed by us from early April to mid-June of this year appears to have engaged in
unauthorized activity involving a small number of member accounts. The personal information available for viewing by this
person included full name, social security number, driver’s license number and other financial information. Our records
indicate that this person viewed your account, most likely as part of their job duties.
We take the security of your personal information very seriously. Please be assured that we terminated this person and
continue to work with law enforcement and appropriate government agencies. At this time, we are not aware of any fraudulent
or improper use of your personal information, nor are we aware of any subsequent disclosure of your data, but to be cautious,
we are providing this notice to you. Please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident to
date, and that we will continue to investigate and take any additional steps that may be required to ensure your personal
information is protected.
Securing your personal information is important to us. As a precautionary measure to safeguard your information from
potential misuse, we have partnered with Equifax to provide its Credit Watch™ Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring identity theft
protection product for one year at no charge to you. A description of this product is provided in the attached material, which
also contains instructions about how to enroll (including your personal activation code). If you choose to take advantage
of this product, it will provide you with a notification of any changes to your credit information, $1 million Identity Fraud
Expense Coverage and access to your credit report. You must complete the enrollment process by April 15, 2016. We urge
you to consider enrolling in this product, at our expense, and reviewing additional resources enclosed with this letter.
In addition to enrolling and receiving the monitoring services described above, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review
your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. You are entitled to one free credit report
annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com.
At no charge, you may also place a “fraud alert” on your credit file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify your
identity prior to granting credit in your name. Please note that placing a fraud alert may delay your ability to obtain credit
while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place
fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report,
please contact any one of the agencies listed below.
	Equifax	          Experian	         TransUnion

You can educate yourself regarding identity theft and the steps you can take to protect yourself by contacting your state
Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC also encourages those who discover that their information
has been misused to file a complaint with them. The FTC can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC
20580, www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/, 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. Instances of
known or suspected identity theft should be reported to law enforcement, your state Attorney General, and the FTC. You can
also further educate yourself about placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file by contacting the FTC or your
state Attorney General.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and very much regret that this situation occurred. Your
confidence in our ability to safeguard your personal information and your peace of mind are very important to us. Should you
have any questions or concerns regarding this matter or the protections available to you, please call 1-866-283-5541.
Sincerely,

Directions for placing a Fraud Alert
A fraud alert is a consumer statement added to your credit report. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent
activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once
the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name.
To place a fraud alert on your credit file, visit: www.fraudalerts.equifax.com or you may contact the Equifax auto fraud line
at 1-877-478-7625, and follow the simple prompts. Once the fraud alert has been placed with Equifax, a notification will
be sent to the other two credit reporting agencies, Experian and Trans Union, on your behalf.
