Dear BayBio Customer,

It has come to our attention that sometime within the past two weeks the security of our online payment
system was breached. We believe an intruder inserted files that captured the keystrokes of our visitors and
may have captured credit card numbers in the process.

You are receiving this because you have made a transaction at BayBio.org’s checkout page to pay for an
event or membership. Please review your credit card statement and immediately alert your bank if you see
any unusual transactions or unfamiliar vendor names.

We are taking these matters seriously and are working to resolve this security issue as quickly as we can and
to install tightened security measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. We will advise you when we’ve
completed these actions and have restored the security of our online payment system.

For the present time, enrollment in events and membership renewals can be accomplished through
www.baybio.org without providing credit card information. Payments will be processed by phone until our web
page security problem is fixed.

Your online security while using the BayBio site is of the utmost concern to us. We regret any inconvenience
this problem may have caused you. We truly appreciate your participation in the BayBio community.

Regards,

Gail Maderis
