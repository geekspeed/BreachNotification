Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>,

We are writing to inform you that a data incident has taken place at Kroll Background
Screening Services (Kroll) involving personal information. Kroll performs background
checks for many companies, including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and our
affiliates (collectively, “we”, “us”, or, the “Company”). According to available records we
believe that you provided personal information to Kroll for a background check
performed in connection with your application for employment or performance of
services for the Company. Some of your personal information, including your name,
Social Security Number, address, employment, and academic histories may have been
on Kroll servers or networks impacted by this data incident.

On September 25, 2013, Kroll notified us that its systems were targeted by third parties
for the purpose of obtaining background check information maintained by Kroll. Kroll
told us that this intrusion into Kroll’s network began in June 2013 and continued until the
second week of September. According to Kroll and published press reports, Kroll was
one of several companies whose systems were targeted.

We have received briefings from Kroll and understand that Kroll is continuing its
investigation into this incident. We also understand that a federal criminal investigation
is underway into the persons behind this intrusion.

At this time, the Company has no evidence that your personal information has been
taken. However, given the circumstances surrounding this incident, we concluded that
the best course of action was to notify you and other potentially affected individuals of
this incident and to advise you of complimentary credit protection services that we are
making available. We have arranged to have AllClear ID provide identity protection
services at no cost to you. These identity protection services, described below by AllClear

For residents of Massachusetts and West Virginia
It is required by state law that you are informed of your right to obtain a police report if you are a victim of identity theft. You also have
the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being
approved in your name without your consent; however, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to send a request to a consumer reporting agency at the addresses provided
above by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail. The following information must be included when requesting a security
freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full
name, with middle initial and any suffices; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses
for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor
Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or
insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.
The consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of
identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident
to the consumer reporting agency.
