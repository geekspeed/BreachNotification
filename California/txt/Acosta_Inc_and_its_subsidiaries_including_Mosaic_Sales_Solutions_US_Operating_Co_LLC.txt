What happened?      On November 10, 2014, the personal automobile of an associate in the Companys Human
Resources department was burglarized. Stolen from the automobile were various personal items and a Company

The Company immediately initiated an investigation to determine what sensitive information may have been
contained on the laptop at the time of theft. The Company confirmed that the laptop was password protected at

your email address.

are not aware of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information. Nevertheless, we are providing you
with helpful information on protection against identity theft and fraud, as well as access to one free year of
credit monitoring and identity restoration services. We are also taking steps to minimize the risk of similar
future data incidents. These steps include enhancing our policies and procedures relating to the security and
confidentiality of Company records containing personal information.
What You Can Do.       Enclosed is helpful information on how to protect against identity theft and fraud. You
can also enroll to receive the free year of credit monitoring and identity restoration services we are offering to
you. Please see the enclosed Notice of Privacy Safeguards for enrollment instructions.                                    0000001

*Identity theft insurance is underwritten by insurance company subsidiaries or affiliates of AIG Insurance. The description herein is a
summary and intended for informational purposes only and does not include all terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies
described. Please refer to the actual policies for terms, conditions, and exclusions of coverage. Coverage may not be available in all

                                                                                                                                          A6701-L02
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your file that alerts creditors to take
additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the
agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to
place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions
regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.
