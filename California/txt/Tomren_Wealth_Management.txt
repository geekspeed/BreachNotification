We are writing to infonn you about a recent incident that may have involved personal information about you.
We recently discovered that, between February 21 and Marcl, 6, 2013 , a server containing information about you

the security of personal information.

We began investigating the incident as soon as we leamed of it. The forensic examiners found spamming
software was loaded onto the machine in a failed attempt to send out'Junk" spam emails, however, we have been
unable to determine whether the unauthorized party accessed any personal infonnation relating to you.
Nonetheless, the server did contain your nallle, Social Security number, driver's license informatiori and your
FSC broker account number. At no time was there ever any access to your actual accotrnts and holdings with our
firm. We have reviewed the daily transaction reports and we have found no irregularities. We have examined and
will continue examining the measures we can take to help prevent incidents of this kind in the future. For
example, we have upgraded the firewall, changed all passwords, deleted ceftain applications and hired forensic
examiners to ensure the system is and will be free of threats.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporling agency. If you
discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that
the credit reporting agency delete that information from your file. In addition, under federal law, you are
entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit
reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to
www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit
reporting agencies at:

In addition, you can add a frar"rd alert to your credit repoft file to help protect your credit information. A
fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to
follow- ceftain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may
place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting ager,cies listed
above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notifli the other two agencies, which then
must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, yoll may contact the nationwide credit reporting
agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on your credit report to prohibit a credit
reporting agency frorn releasing information from your credit report without your prior written
authorization.

Please know that we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you. Be assured that
we take very seriously the security of your information. Please do not hesitate to contact us at (925) 830-
1700 ifyou have any questions or concerns.
