Dear <<Customer Name>>:
We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are making
you aware of a situation that may have exposed customer information including customer names, addresses, phone numbers
and encrypted credit card numbers with security codes.
WHAT HAPPENED?
We discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained unlawful access to certain temporary data files on our website.
These temporary data files are used only to complete e-commerce transactions and are not otherwise retained by Bellacor.
The information accessed in the temporary files included customer name, address, phone number and encrypted credit card
information. The malicious code used by the unauthorized party was discovered and contained on July 26th, and we believe
it was injected by the unauthorized third party around June 7th. While our investigation is ongoing, we believe that in
certain limited circumstances the unauthorized third party was able to extract such information from the temporary data
files. Your recent purchase occurred during the time period when the unauthorized third party was attempting to obtain this
information about our customers. While we do not have evidence that your information was compromised, we are taking
precautionary measures to protect your financial security and alleviate concerns you may have.
WHAT IS BELLACOR DOING TO ADDRESS THIS SITUATION?
We are taking measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack, including removing the malicious code and
modifying relevant procedures and processes on our website. We have also mounted an aggressive investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the situation, including working with the appropriate authorities. We have conducted a review
of our own internal security and training, and are implementing additional security procedures.
We are offering you one year of credit monitoring, a credit report, ongoing educational materials, and resolution services
should your information be accessed and misused. These services will be provided by Identity Theft 911. They are highly
