Dear Sample A. Sample:

We are strongly committed to the security of our customers’ information and strive to let you know about
security concerns as soon as possible. We recently learned of an incident on our websites (boats.net and
partzilla.com) that may have exposed your personal information to unauthorized persons. This
notification to you was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

We believe the incident occurred when unauthorized third parties compromised and inserted malware into
the shopping cart portions of our websites. The malware appears to have targeted transactions by
customers that made purchases on our websites using a credit card between December 2012 and July
2013. You are receiving this notice because our records indicate you made a credit card purchase on one
of the above websites during this time period. The malware may have collected the following personal
information from affected customers: name, address, credit card number, card expiration date and card
security code (CVV or CVC code).

Upon learning of the incident, we immediately took steps to notify all potentially affected credit card
companies so they can take any actions necessary to protect your credit card account. You can take the
following additional precautionary steps to further protect yourself.

     ·     Remain vigilant – We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements
           and free credit reports.

                 o     If you discover errors or suspicious activity on your credit card account, you should
                       immediately contact the credit card company and inform them that you have received this
                       letter. Confirm the address they have on file for you is your current address, and that all
                       charges on the account are legitimate.

                 o     To obtain an annual free copy of your credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or
                       call 1-877-322-8228. Review your credit reports carefully for inquiries from companies
                       you did not contact, accounts you did not open or debts on your accounts that you do not
                       recognize. Also make sure to verify the accuracy of your Social Security Number,
                       address(es), complete name and employer(s) information. If information on a report is
                       incorrect, notify the credit bureau directly using the telephone number on the report.
                       Additional contact information for the major credit bureaus is as follows:

                         Equifax:                     Experian:                            TransUnion:

   ·   Consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file – Credit bureaus have
       tools you can use to protect your credit, including fraud alerts and security freezes.

              o   A fraud alert is a cautionary flag, which is placed on your credit file to notify lenders and
                  others that they should take special precautions to ensure your identity before extending
                  credit. Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for credit, it
                  might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. Call any one of the
                  three credit reporting agencies at the numbers below to place fraud alerts with all three of
                  the agencies.

                               Equifax:            Experian:        TransUnion:
                               1-888-766-0008      1-888-397-3742   1-800-680-7289

              o   A security freeze is a more dramatic step that will prevent lenders and others from
                  accessing your credit report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit.
                  With a security freeze in place, even you will need to take special steps when applying
                  for credit. A security freeze may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of
                  any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or other
                  services. A security freeze will need to be obtained separately from each credit reporting
                  agency. You must contact each credit agency separately to order a security freeze. You
                  can obtain more information by visiting the credit bureaus at the following addresses.

              Equifax – https://www.freeze.equifax.com/Freeze/jsp/SFF_PersonalIDInfo.jsp
              Experian – http://www.experian.com/consumer/security_freeze.html
              TransUnion – http://www.transunion.com/personal-credit/credit-disputes/credit-freezes.page

   ·   Report suspicious activity – If you believe you are the victim of fraud or identity theft, file a
       police report and get a copy of the report to submit to your creditors and others that may require
       proof of a crime to clear up your records. The report may also provide you with access to
       services that are free to identity theft victims.
