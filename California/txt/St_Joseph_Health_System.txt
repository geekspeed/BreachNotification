Dear John Q Sample,*

St. Joseph Health System (“SJHS”) based in Bryan, Texas, is writing to inform you of an incident
that may affect your personal information.

Between Monday, December 16 and Wednesday, December 18, 2013, SJHS experienced a security
attack in which hackers gained unauthorized access to one server on its computer system. SJHS
acted quickly, shutting down access to the involved computer on December 18, and hiring national
security and computer forensics experts to thoroughly investigate this matter. Our investigation,
which is ongoing, determined that this security attack may have resulted in unauthorized access to
records for some SJHS patients, employees, and some employees’ beneficiaries. These records
include your name, and possibly your address.

While it is possible that some information was accessed or taken, the forensics investigation has
been unable to confirm this, which is why we are providing this notice to you. The computer was
shut down when we discovered the security attack on December 18, 2013, so we believe the
potential risk to your information ended on that date. SJHS is working with the United States
Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is also looking into this incident.

It is important to note that SJHS has received no reports that any of your personal information has
been misused. We take this matter, and the security of your personal information, very seriously.
As a precaution, SJHS wants to assist you in protecting your identity even though we are not aware
of any misuse of your information and we have been unable to determine whether any data was in
fact taken. SJHS has also hired AllClear ID to protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you.             *0103000000*

When you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. Look for accounts or creditor inquiries that you
did not initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home address and Social Security number,
that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the
telephone number on the report.

We recommend you remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and
promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement
authorities, including local law enforcement, your state’s attorney general and/or the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”). You may contact the FTC or your state’s regulatory authority to obtain additional
information about avoiding identity theft.

provider and request them to send such statements following the provision of services in your name or
number.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your
creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that
an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim
of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an
extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the
appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You
can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national
credit reporting agencies listed below.

Equifax: 1-800-525-6285, www.equifax.com
Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, www.transunion.com

Credit Freezes (for Non-Massachusetts Residents): You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also
known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the
use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent
potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze,
potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you
temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In
addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to
state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5
to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit
freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a
credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified
below to find out more information:

Equifax, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
Experian, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022, www.transunion.com

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the
national credit reporting agencies listed above.

Credit Freezes (for Massachusetts Residents): Massachusetts law gives you the right to place a security
freeze on your consumer reports. A security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from
being approved in your name without your consent. Using a security freeze, however, may delay your ability
to obtain credit. You may request that a freeze be placed on your credit report by sending a request to a
credit reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail or regular stamped mail to the address below:

Equifax, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
Experian, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022, www.transunion.com

Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting
company. The following information should be included when requesting a security freeze (documentation
for you and your spouse must be submitted when freezing a spouse’s credit report): full name, with middle
initial and any suffixes; Social Security number; date of birth (month, day and year); current address and
previous addresses for the past five (5) years; and applicable fee (if any) or incident report or complaint with
a law enforcement agency or the Department of Motor Vehicles. The request should also include a copy of a
government-issued identification card, such as a driver’s license, state or military ID card, and a copy of a
utility bill, bank or insurance statement. Each copy should be legible, display your name and current mailing
address, and the date of issue (statement dates must be recent). The credit reporting company may charge a
reasonable fee of up to $5 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft
or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft
to the credit reporting company.
