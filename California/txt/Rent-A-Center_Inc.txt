Important Security and Protection Notification.
Please read this entire letter.
Dear Sample A. Sample,
Rent-A-Center is committed to the responsible handling of customer information and takes our obligation
to protect personal information seriously. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you about an incident
regarding some of your personal information.

On April 1, 2012, various electronics were stolen from a Rent-A-Center store including the store’s
inventory and the computer equipment used to run the store. We discovered the theft on April 2, 2012
when the store’s employees returned to work. The incident was reported to the Clovis Police Department
and we immediately began a thorough investigation to identify the information contained on the store’s
computer equipment. One of the store’s servers contained some of your personal information including
your name and Social Security number or driver’s license number. The server also contained any
additional information you may have provided on your initial rental application. The information on the
server was password protected. To date, the server has not been recovered.

Rent-A-Center has no reason to believe that the server was taken for the information it contained or that
the information has been accessed or used improperly. Various electronics in the store’s inventory,
including televisions, gaming systems, tablets and other computers were also taken. As a precautionary
measure however, to help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary one year membership
of Experian’s ProtectMyIDTM Alert. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal
information and provides you with superior identity protection services focused on immediate
identification and resolution of identity theft. For more information on ProtectMyID and instructions
on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the page attached to this
letter.
                                                                                                                        63445015001000000010102

remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your credit report and credit
card, bank, and other financial statements for any unauthorized activity. You may also obtain a copy of
