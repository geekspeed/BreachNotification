          Dear [Salutation] [Last Name],

          This letter is to notify you that the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) sent your personal
          information to another government entity in error.

          What happened? On September 28, 2015, a DMV employee was sending a file containing your
          personal information to the Santa Clara Transportation Agency as part of the agency’s Employer
          Pull Notice (EPN) program. The EPN program provides agencies with a means of promoting
          driver safety through the ongoing review of driver records.

          However, the employee also sent the file to another government entity, Riverside Probation
          Department, by mistake.

          On October 9, 2015, the Riverside Probation Department reported the incident to DMV and
          deleted the file.

          What personal information was disclosed? The file contained your name and driver license
          number. Your Social Security Number was not released.

          Why did it take so long to notify me? The Department did not discover the incident until the
          Riverside Probation Department reported the error. Action was taken by the DMV to evaluate
          the incident and notify you of the error.

          What has DMV done to correct the problem? The primary cause of the incident was due to
          human error by a DMV employee. The employee involved was retrained on proper policy and
          procedures.

          The Department stresses the importance of protecting personal information of our customers to
          all of our employees. The DMV is continuously providing employee awareness training and
          reviewing our policies and procedures in an effort to prevent this type of incident from occurring.
