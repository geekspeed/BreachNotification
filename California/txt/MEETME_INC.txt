For Immediate Release
                           MEETME STATUTORY NOTICE	  

NEW HOPE, Pa., August 15, 2014 — MeetMe, Inc. today announced that it has
recently discovered a security breach within its network that compromised certain
information in at least some MeetMe user accounts. Specifically, between August 5 and
7 of this year, MeetMe believes that hackers gained access to some user names, email
addresses, and encrypted passwords. For a period of time, the hackers may have been
able to access the affected MeetMe accounts, but there is no evidence that they did so
and they can no longer do so.

MeetMe has contacted its users regarding the incident by email and by site posting.
MeetMe recommended to its users that they change their passwords and, if they used
their MeetMe passwords for other purposes, to change them there as well.
