Dear Sample A Sample:
The East San Gabriel Valley Regional Occupational Program recognizes the importance of the
privacy and confidentiality of the personal information of our students.  Regrettably, we are writing
to inform you of an incident involving some of your personal information.
On December 11, 2012, we learned that an employee sent a career placement e-mail to students
regarding open positions which inadvertently included an attachment containing student information.
The attachment contained student attendance information, including your name, date of birth, Social
Security number, and information regarding your program.     
While we have no reason to believe your information has been used improperly, we are offering at no
cost to you a one-year membership of Experians® ProtectMyID® Alert. This product helps detect
possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection
services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is
completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. Unfortunately,
due to privacy laws, we are not able to enroll you directly.               For more information on identity theft

prevention and ProtectMyID Alert, including instructions on how to activate your

complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this

letter.



We want to assure you that we are committed to the security of your personal information entrusted
to us by our students. We are taking this matter seriously and we regret that this occurred. We have
re-enforced with our employees the importance of safeguarding personal information.  If you have
any questions, please feel free to call 877-631-0440, Monday through Friday between 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. Pacific Time and provide the ten digit passcode 3278122612 when prompted.
Sincerely,


Josephine Quach
Chief Financial Officer
East San Gabriel Valley Regional Occupational Program
