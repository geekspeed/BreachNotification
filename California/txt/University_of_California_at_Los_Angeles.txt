<<Dear Name>>:

At UCLA Health, our patients come first. Patient confidentiality is a critical part of our commitment to care and
we work hard to protect your personal information. We are writing to inform you of a recent event that may have
involved personal information of patients who received services in the Department of Radiation Oncology during
the last three years. This event is unrelated to the cyberattack of UCLA Health’s network, about which you may
have also recently received a letter. At this time, there is no evidence that any of your personal information has been
improperly accessed, disclosed, or used.

On July 3, 2015, a laptop computer belonging to a UCLA Health faculty member was stolen from his locked car while
he was traveling. The computer was password-protected and stored limited information about some UCLA Health
patients.

The information on the computer may have included your first initial or first name and last name, and one or more of
the following pieces of your information: date of birth, medical record number, phone number, email address, dates
of treatment, and medical information related to your treatment plan. The information did not include your Social
Security Number, health insurance information, or other financial information like a credit card number.

As noted, we have no evidence that any information about you maintained on the computer has been
improperly accessed, disclosed, or used, and no patient financial information was stored on the computer. In
addition, UCLA Health has policies and programs in place to identify “red flags” or warnings of possible
medical identity theft and inform patients when these are found. The California Attorney General has
also published guidelines to help patients and consumers protect themselves. These are available online at
https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/facts/medical-privacy/med-id-theft. Finally, UCLA Health is enhancing its security policies
and retraining those involved with the incident to help avoid any future similar events.

We apologize for any concern or inconvenience this matter may cause you. Our patients always come first, and we
continue to work diligently to protect your personal information. If you would like additional information about this
incident, please contact ID Experts, the vendor we have engaged to assist UCLA Health at 888-236-0447.

Sincerely,


<<Signature>>


Marti Arvin
