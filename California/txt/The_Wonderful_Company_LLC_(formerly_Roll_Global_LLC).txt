Dear <<Insert name>>:
Please read this letter in its entirety.
We are writing to inform you of an isolated security incident involving your personal information. Specifically, a laptop
computer that included certain employee data provided to HUB International (“HUB”) by or on behalf of your current or
former employer, Roll Global LLC or one of its affiliated companies (“Roll”), was recently stolen. On behalf of HUB, I want
to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and provide you with some information on what happened, as well as
the steps we are taking to protect you.
What Happened?
Roll engaged HUB to provide risk management services related to its workers’ compensation insurance program. On
February 27, 2015, a HUB employee supporting these services had his password-protected laptop stolen from his locked
car. HUB immediately began to investigate and recreate any unencrypted information that might have been accessible
from the laptop’s hard drive. Through this process, we were able to ascertain by March 12, that the laptop contained data
that included your name and certain information that is commonly needed to assess workers’ compensation premiums
and claims (e.g., the date on which you made a workers’ compensation claim, the claim number, brief accident and
injury descriptions and compensation amounts related to the claim). We are in the process of taking steps to reduce the
likelihood of such an event occurring again. Unfortunately, your social security number does appear to have been included
in the data associated with your claim information.
In contrast with large-scale breaches of corporate data servers that have been prevalent in the news as of late, individual
laptop thefts are more often motivated by the value of the hardware, and not by the value of any data that may be stored on
the hardware itself. We, in turn, currently have no reason to believe that any of your personal information was compromised
or misused in any manner.
What are HUB and Roll Doing to Protect You?
We have taken extensive steps to address this incident quickly and effectively and are still taking appropriate precautionary
measures to better ensure the security of information we hold and help alleviate concerns you may have. Namely, we are
providing you with access to Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring services at no charge. For twenty-four months from the date
of enrollment, these services provide you with an alert each time a change occurs to any of one of your Experian, Equifax or
TransUnion credit files. This alert is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. These
services will be provided by IDT911, a company that specializes in identity theft education and resolution.
To enroll in Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com/

What Can You Do on Your Own to Address the Situation?
There are important steps that you can take at any time to reduce the likelihood of identity theft or fraud:
   	   Review credit card bills
   	   Review other financial account information, including bank account and savings statements
   	   Watch your accounts for activity that you may not have authorized
   	   Contact the place where you have the account immediately if you notice any unauthorized activity or transaction
We also recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they
open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. To do so, contact any one of the three major credit bureaus. As soon
as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts.
