September 11, 2015

Dear [INSERT First_Last_Name],

In July 2015, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (“CVS”) learned of reports of unusual activity involving payment cards used on
the CVSPhoto.com website, which is managed and hosted by an independent vendor, PNI Digital Media (“PNI”).
We promptly took down the website, and began working with PNI to investigate the reports. We continue to
actively investigate the matter, working with PNI and experienced forensic investigators.
On August 13, 2015, investigators informed CVS that, between June 2014 and July 2015, there was an illegal
intrusion into PNI’s systems that host the CVSPhoto.com website. This intrusion potentially resulted in the
unauthorized acquisition of data entered by certain users on CVSPhoto.com. Based on the facts known to the
company at this time, the potentially affected personal information may have included your first and last name,
payment card number, expiration date, card verification code, address, phone number, email address, and
username and password for logging in to a CVSPhoto.com account. Importantly, at this time, there is no
indication that the potentially affected information included pin numbers or photographic images.
We want to assure our customers that the CVSPhoto.com website and online payment system are completely
separate from CVS.com and our pharmacies. The incident occurred only within PNI’s network. The incident
did not impact financial transactions on CVS.com or in-store.
What we are doing to protect you
We have arranged for customers who used a payment card on CVSPhoto.com between June 2014 and July 2015
                                                                                                 ®            ®

As explained above, CVS promptly disabled CVSPhoto.com to try to mitigate any potential loss of customer data.
We are working diligently to re-launch the website, including reviewing the security practices for the vendor host.
We have also advised the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies about this incident.
What you can do to protect yourself
Regardless of whether you take advantage of the identity theft protection and credit monitoring services available
from Experian, please review the information in the enclosed Reference Guide to learn about additional steps you
can take to monitor and protect against unauthorized use of your personal information.
Please remember that CVSPhoto.com will never ask you for personal or account information in an e-mail. Please
exercise caution if you receive any emails or phone calls that ask for personal information or direct you to a web
site where you are asked to provide personal information. We also recommend that you change your password
on any other website or for any other systems where you use the same or a similar username and password
combination. We encourage you to use a “strong” password that is different from your prior CVSPhoto.com
password. According to the Federal Trade Commission, strong passwords tend to be long and include a mix of
letters, numbers and characters.
What should I do if I have any questions?
After reviewing the Reference Guide, if you have any questions regarding this incident or if you desire further
information or assistance, please call 1-888-829-6553 between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. PST, Monday through Friday
and between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. PST, Saturday and Sunday.

For residents of Illinois and West Virginia:
Information Regarding Placement of a Security Freeze on your Credit File

A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without
your consent; however, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.
To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to send a request to a consumer reporting agency by
certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail. The following information must be included when
requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information
must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security
number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any
applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The
request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or
bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing
address, and the date of issue.

For residents of Massachusetts:
Placing a Credit Freeze: Massachusetts law also allows consumers to place a security freeze on their credit
reports. See the description above about what a security freeze does and how to order them. Under
Massachusetts law, if you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with
a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit
reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security
freeze.
Obtaining Police Reports: You have a right to obtain a police report relating to this incident. If you are the victim
of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and obtain a copy of it.
