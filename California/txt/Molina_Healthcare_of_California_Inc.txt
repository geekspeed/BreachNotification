Dear <MEMBER NAME>,

This is to let you know that CVS, Molina Healthcare’s Over-the-Counter (OTC) benefits vendor, told us
on 7/20/15 about a breach of your protected health information (PHI). This is to tell you about this
incident and what you can do to protect yourself from potential harm.

On or about 3/26/15, a former CVS employee took PHI from CVS’ computers and sent it to his personal
computer. CVS believes he did this to fraudulently obtain OTC products from CVS. Upon learning of
this incident, CVS took prompt action to investigate this issue. No fraudulent use of your PHI has been
found. The PHI involved in the breach is as follows: Full Name; CVS ID; CVS ExtraCare Health Card
Number; Member ID; Rx Plan Number; Rx Plan State; Start Date; and End Date.

This may put you at risk for identity theft. We think you should place a fraud alert on your credit file. A
fraud alert tells creditors to call you before opening any new accounts. You can call any one of the
agencies below to have a fraud alert placed on your file. A fraud alert lasts for 90 days. You can also get
a free credit report from each agency.

       Equifax                           Experian                         TransUnion

Look at your reports when you get them. Look for accounts you do not remember opening. Look for
requests from creditors that you do not know about. Check for any medical bills that you do not know
about. Look at all your personal information. Make sure it is correct. Call the credit agency if you have
any questions about your report.

If there is something wrong with your report, call your local police or sheriff’s office. File an identity
theft report. Get a copy of this report. You may need to give a copy to other creditors. This will help
clear your records.

If your credit report is OK, you should still check your credit. Check your credit report every three
months for the next year. Call one of the numbers above to get your report.
Keep a copy of this letter for your records. It can help if you have future problems with your medical
records. You may want to ask for a copy of your medical records from your healthcare providers. It is
good to have a copy that you can look at in case you ever have problems. You can also get a copy of your
claims or other PHI held by Molina Medicare Options Plus HMO SNP (Molina Healthcare). To get it
please call our Member Services department at the toll-free number listed below.

Molina Healthcare regrets this problem. CVS is replacing CVS ExtraCare Health Cards for affected
individuals who are current Molina Healthcare members with an OTC benefit, unless your CVS
ExtraCare Health Card was already replaced due to a change in your benefits plan. To further help
protect your identity, we are offering you a free one-year membership of identity theft protection.

To learn more about subscribing for identity protection, please feel free to contact CVS Customer
Service at (888) 217-5370. To help stop more breaches we are working with CVS to even better secure
your data and to ensure this does not happen again.

If there is more Molina Healthcare can do to help you, please call our Member Services Department at
(800) 665-3086, 7 days a week, 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM local time, (TTY 711).

Sincerely,


Molina Healthcare
