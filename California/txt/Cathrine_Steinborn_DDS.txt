Dear <<Name>>,

As a follow up to my previous correspondence, I am writing to provide you with additional information about the
January 5, 2015 burglary at our office and helpful information on how to protect against identity theft and fraud. We
remain unaware of any actual misuse of your personal and protected health information.

What happened? As you know, our office was burglarized on January 5, 2015. Among other things, the intruder(s)
took a server containing patient and responsible party information. While our investigation into this incident is
ongoing, we’ve determined that your address, [date of birth], [telephone number], [Social Security number], [insurance
information], [medical information], [treatment information], [billing information] and name were stored on the
server at the time of the theft. The server did not contain your bank account or credit/debit card information, as
we do not store this information.

What we are doing. We reported this matter to law enforcement and filed a police report immediately upon discovery
of the burglary. Since the burglary, we have increased physical security and surveillance of the premises. We have
also encrypted patient and responsible party information, and enhanced physical security of the server on which
this information is stored. We previously provided notice of this incident to you, and are providing you additional
information about the incident and helpful information on protecting against identity theft and fraud. To help protect
your identity, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian’s® ProtectMyID® Alert. This
product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection
support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.

                 800-525-6285                      888-397-3742                           800-680-7289

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert” on your file that alerts creditors to take
additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency
verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud
alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit
report, please contact any one of the agencies listed above.

You can also further educate yourself regarding identity theft, and the steps you can take to protect yourself, by
contacting your state Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission. For North Carolina residents, the
Attorney General can be contacted at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-919-716-6400,
www.ncdoj.gov. For Maryland residents, the Attorney General can be contacted at 200 St. Paul Place, 16th Floor,
Baltimore, MD 21202, (888) 743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those
who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. The Federal Trade Commission
can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-ID-THEFT
(1-877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should be reported to law
enforcement, your Attorney General, and the FTC. You can also further educate yourself about placing a fraud alert
or security freeze on your credit file by contacting the FTC or your state’s Attorney General.
