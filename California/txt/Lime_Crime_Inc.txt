Dear <<Insert Name>>,
Lime Crime is writing to inform you of an incident involving personal information you provided to limecrime.com (the “Website”). We
value our relationship with you, and as a precaution, we are providing this notice and outlining some steps you may take to help protect
yourself. We sincerely apologize for any frustration or concern this may cause you.
On February 11, 2015, after an extensive forensic investigation, we learned that on October 4, 2014 unauthorized individuals installed
malicious software on the computer server hosting the Website. We believe the malware could have compromised the personal
information of customers that made credit or debit card purchases through the Website between October 4, 2014 and February 15,
2015, including name, address, website username and password, payment card account number, card expiration date, and payment
card security code. According to our records, you made a payment card purchase at the Website during that timeframe and your
information may be at risk.
Lime Crime takes the privacy of personal information seriously, and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We have taken steps
to address this incident including temporarily taking the Website offline to prevent any further theft of personal information. In
addition, we replaced the e-commerce platform we previously used with a new platform, which has undergone a security vulnerability
scan and code review and is further certified as PCI compliant. As of now, the incident has been contained and eliminated.
We want to make you aware of steps you can take to guard against fraud or identity theft. We recommend that you review your current
and past credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible for discrepancies or unusual activity. You should remain vigilant
and continue to monitor your statements for unusual activity going forward. If you see anything you do not understand or that looks
suspicious, or if you suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, you should call the bank that issued the credit or debit
card immediately.
We are also initiating a password reset for the Website, which will require you to change your password. Please note, if you use the
same password for limecrime.com on other online accounts, we recommend that you change your password for those accounts as well.
We also recommend that you carefully check your credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries from creditors you did
not initiate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. If you find any suspicious activity on your
credit reports, call your local police or sheriff’s office, and file a police report for identity theft and get a copy of it. You may need
to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records. Also, please review the enclosed “Information about Identity
Theft Protection” reference guide that describes additional steps you may take to help protect yourself, including details on how to
place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file.
In addition, to help protect your identity, we have engaged Experian®, the largest credit bureau in the U.S., to offer you complimentary
fraud resolution and identity protection services for one-year. If you are a victim of fraud, simply call Experian at 866-926-9801 by
February 19, 2016 and a dedicated Identity Theft Resolution agent will help you. Please provide the following engagement number

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should
promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities,
including local law enforcement, your state’s attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
You may contact the FTC or your state’s regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and

NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft
For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the
Maryland Office of the Attorney General: Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division,
200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors
on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud
alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An
initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your
credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended
fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting
any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed below:
Equifax                               Experian                                 TransUnion
P.O. Box 740241                       P.O. Box 9532                            Fraud Victim Assistance Division
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                Allen, TX 75013                          P.O. Box 6790
877-478-7625; www.equifax.com         888-397-3742; www.experian.com           Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                               800-916-8800; www.transunion.com
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file,
so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get
access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws
vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state,
generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a
credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit
freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find
out more information.
