Dear ______________:
We are writing to you on behalf of Voya Financial Advisors, Inc. (“VFA”) and your financial advisor, [INSERT NAME].
[INSERT NAME] along with several other financial advisors, recently became a victim of identity theft. Unfortunately, we
discovered on or shortly after April 13, 2016 that the perpetrators of this scheme used [INSERT NAME]’s personal
information to gain unauthorized access to VFA’s systems and [INSERT NAME]’s client records.
WHAT HAPPENED
Perpetrators used your financial advisor’s personal information to gain unauthorized access to VFA’s systems, including
[INSERT NAME]’s client records. VFA was able to detect and remediate the unauthorized access within a matter of hours,
but it is possible that the perpetrator viewed your personal information while in the system.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED
The information that the perpetrator may have viewed includes your name, address, date of birth, [last four digits of your]
social security number, [driver’s license, passport or other government issued photo ID number], telephone number, email
address, employer, account numbers and balances for various financial accounts, and other financial information such as
income and net worth. We deeply regret that this happened.
WHAT WE ARE DOING
VFA is actively investigating this matter. The FBI has reported that VFA is not the only financial services company to
recently experience this type of attack. VFA has also implemented additional measures to safeguard against similar,
unauthorized access to its systems.

Please be assured that we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. To assist you in protecting yourself
against identity theft, we are providing you with one year of FREE credit monitoring and identity fraud coverage through
Equifax Personal Solutions. There is an activation code at the top of this letter that can be redeemed for this service.

advantage of this free service.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
Be on the alert for suspicious activity related to your accounts, credit report and financial products. You will have access to
your Equifax consumer credit report as part of the Equifax Credit Watch™ Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring product. We
recommend that you also take the following steps to protect your identity:
    •    Check your other consumer reports annually. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12
         months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com
         or by contacting the consumer reporting agencies at:

         appropriate service provider and to one of the national credit reporting companies listed below, and ask for a fraud
         alert or a security freeze on your credit report. Remember to renew the fraud alerts every 90 days.

         personal records.
