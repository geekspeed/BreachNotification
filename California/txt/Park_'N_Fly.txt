             Park ‘N Fly Notifies Customers of Data Security Compromise

ATLANTA – Jan. 13, 2015 – Park ‘N Fly (“PNF”) has become aware of a security compromise
involving payment card data processed through its e-commerce website. PNF has been working
continuously to understand the nature and scope of the incident, and has engaged third-party data
forensics experts to assist with its investigation. The data compromise has been contained.
While the investigation is ongoing, it has been determined that the security of some data from
certain payment cards that were used to make reservations through PNF’s e-commerce website is
at risk. The data potentially at risk includes the card number, cardholder’s name and billing
address, card expiration date, and CVV code. Other loyalty customer data potentially at risk
includes email addresses, Park ‘N Fly passwords, and telephone numbers.

PNF is encouraging customers to take steps to protect their identity and financial information,
and has established a toll-free call center to answer customer questions. As the investigation
continues, and out of an abundance of caution, PNF also is offering identity monitoring and
identity protection services to potentially affected customers, free of charge for the next 12
months. PNF customers can visit www.pnf.com/security-update to learn more about this data
security event and the support and services being provided.

PNF also suggests that customers remain vigilant and seek to protect against possible identity
theft or other financial loss by reviewing account statements for any unusual activity, notifying
their credit card companies of the potential data compromise, and monitoring their credit reports.

major credit bureaus. To obtain a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call,
toll-free, (877) 322-8228.

At no charge, PNF customers can also have these credit bureaus place a "fraud alert" on their
files that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify their identity prior to granting credit in
their names. Please note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to
protect the individual’s credit, it may also delay the ability to obtain credit while the agency
verifies the individual’s identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms an individual’s fraud
alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on that individual’s file. Any individual wishing
to place a fraud alert, or who has questions regarding their credit report, can contact any one of
