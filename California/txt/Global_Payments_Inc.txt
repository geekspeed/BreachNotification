     Dear JOHN SMITH4,

     Global Payments’ ongoing investigation into a security event recently revealed
     potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected
     from a subset of merchant applicants. This data may have included your name,
     social security number and business bank account number designated for the
     deposit of merchant processing proceeds.

     It is unclear whether any personal information from Global Payments’ systems was
     looked at or taken by an unauthorized party; however, we want to notify you and
     provide assistance and material that will help you safeguard your personal
     information. This letter has not been delayed by a law enforcement investigation.




                                                                                               000001-000001
     Because we value your relationship and regret any inconvenience arising from this
     matter, we have arranged for Equifax Personal Solutions to make available credit
     monitoring and $1,000,000 of identity protection insurance to you at no cost for one
     year. The steps to sign up for the Equifax product are set forth in the attached
     Reference Guide. We have also advised the three major U.S. credit reporting
     agencies about this matter.

     Please know that privacy and security are central to the integrity of our services, and
     we sincerely apologize for any concern this matter may cause. We believe that this
     incident is contained and you can be assured that we have enhanced our hardware
     and software systems, network monitoring and security procedures. Please note
     that this has no impact on any merchant’s ability to process credit or debit
     transactions.

     We also have provided additional information at www.2012infosecurityupdate.com.

     If you have any other questions or if you desire further information or assistance,
     please call 800-449-4301 between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday
     through Friday.

      Order Your Free Credit Report To order your free annual credit report, visit
      www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the Annual
      Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”)
      website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.
      Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three credit bureaus provide free annual
      credit reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.

      Upon receiving your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not
      open. Look in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you have not
      requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or
      commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. Look in
      the “personal information” section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home
      address and Social Security Number).

      If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone
      number on the report. Errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You
      should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to
      error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if
      found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not




                                                                                              000001-000001
      authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in
      writing. Information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local
      police or sheriff’s office because it may signal criminal activity.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming

Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File To protect yourself from possible identity
theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect
against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name.
When a credit grantor checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the
credit grantor gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The
alert notifies the credit grantor to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.
You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free
fraud numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that
allows flagging of your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.

      Credit Freezes You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a
      security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name
      without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A
      credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your
      credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors
      and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you
      temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to
      obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit




                                                                                                  000001-000001
      freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily
      lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per
      action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately
      place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau. Since the instructions
      for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three
      major credit bureaus at the numbers above to obtain more information.
