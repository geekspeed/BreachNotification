                                                  Notice of Data Breach


Dear Gyft User,

We are writing to let you know about an incident that potentially involves your Gyft account. As described
below, an unknown party may have gained unauthorized access to certain Gyft user information. We are taking
this incident very seriously. As soon as Gyft learned about the exposure, we began investigating how this user
information was accessed and what risks this potentially posed to Gyft customers. Fortunately, we have not
discovered evidence that anyone used the information potentially compromised in this incident to access Gyft
accounts or make unauthorized purchases.

Nonetheless, please carefully read this notice.

What Happened?
Beginning on October 3 and continuing through December 18, 2015, an unknown party accessed without
authorization two cloud providers used by Gyft. This unknown party was able to view or download certain Gyft
user information stored with these cloud providers and make a file containing some of that user information.

What Information Was Involved?
The information potentially accessed from the cloud providers included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone
numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers. Gift card numbers could have been used to make unauthorized
purchases. In addition, if you attempted to use Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015, your Gyft
log-in credentials may have been compromised. An unauthorized party who acquired your credentials could have
accessed your Gyft account and used any gift cards in your account with unused balances, or used available reward
points or a Coinbase-enabled account to purchase additional gift cards. Importantly, no credit cards stored in your
Gyft account were compromised because full credit card numbers are not visible in Gyft accounts and any credit
card purchases require the three- or four -digit security code on the back or front of your credit card, which was not
part of the information that may have been compromised.

What Are We Doing?
Shortly after discovering this issue, Gyft acted to prevent unauthorized access by forcing users whose passwords
were potentially compromised to reset their passwords and logging out other affected users. Affected users
who have not already done so will be forced to choose a new password the next time they log in. We also reset
the Coinbase tokens for all affected customers. We are continuing to investigate the incident and will take all
appropriate steps to protect Gyft customers.

What You Can Do
We recommend that you change your password for any online account where you use the same password that you
used for Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015. As discussed above, credit cards stored through Gyft were
not affected by this incident. However, if you have a Coinbase account linked to your Gyft account, we recommend

                                                           -1-
that you review any Coinbase transactions beginning in October 2015, because a linked Coinbase account could
have been used to make purchases within your Gyft account. You should also monitor any gift cards that were in
your Gyft account before January 8, 2016.

Although the information potentially involved in this incident does not affect your credit, we are required by law to
provide you certain information about your credit report and identity theft. This information is enclosed.

You may also contact us in writing at 150 W. Evelyn Avenue, Suite 300, Mountain View, CA 94041, or you can call
us at 866-287-0504.

On behalf of Gyft, we regret any inconvenience this may cause you.

Sincerely,




CJ MacDonald
Chief Operating Officer, Gyft

Additional Information Regarding Identity Theft and Your Credit Report

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides information about how to avoid identity theft and what to do if
you suspect your identity has been stolen. You may contact the FTC at FTC Identity Theft Clearinghouse, 600
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov, 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).
You can also contact local law enforcement or the attorney general’s office in your state if you suspect that you
have been the victim of identity theft.

You also may obtain a free copy of your credit report maintained by each of the three credit reporting agencies by
visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228. Review the reports carefully, and if
you find anything you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency.

You also may consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a
security freeze or to obtain additional information regarding identity theft. An initial fraud alert is free and lasts for
at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the
credit company contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. In contrast, a security freeze prohibits
a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer’s credit report without prior written
permission. Placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay your ability to obtain credit.

To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, contact any the three credit reporting agencies using
