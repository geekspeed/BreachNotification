                                               Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name>>:

What Happened

As a result of ongoing security reviews, TaxSlayer identified on January 13, 2016 that an unauthorized third party,
whom we believe obtained your username and password from another online service, may have accessed your
TaxSlayer account between 10/10/2015 and 12/21/2015. In order to protect your account, we have temporarily disabled
access. You will need to reset your password via the “forgot password” utility on the login page and authenticate
yourself via multi-factor authentication. We have no evidence indicating that the technical security of
TaxSlayer systems has been compromised.

What Information Was Involved

The unauthorized third party may have obtained access to any information you included in a tax return or draft
tax return saved on TaxSlayer, including your name and address, your Social Security number, the Social Security
numbers of your dependents, and other data contained on your 2014 tax return.

For More Information

We recommend that you immediately change your username and password for any other online account for which
you use the same username and password. We also strongly recommend that you obtain an Identity Protection PIN
(IP PIN) from the IRS. This is a unique PIN assigned to you that would be required to file your tax return.


O6481 v.01 01.27.2016
It will ensure that someone else cannot file a return with your Social Security number. You can
obtain this PIN when the IRS begins offering them, estimated to be in late January, by going to
https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-An-Identity-Protection-PIN.

We encourage you to monitor your credit reports for fraudulent transactions or accounts. You may obtain a free copy
of your credit report maintained by each of the three credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.
com or by calling toll-free 877-322-8228. Review the reports carefully, and if you find anything you do not understand
or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency. If you suspect fraudulent activity, you can
contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, and the Federal Trade Commission.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or
security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of
identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one
of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to
your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts. Inquire with the credit reporting
agencies for their specific procedures regarding security freezes.
