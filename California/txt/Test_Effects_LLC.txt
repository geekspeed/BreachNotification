Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you
may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if
you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90
days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate
documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report
by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed below:
Equifax                                 Experian                                  TransUnion
P.O. Box 740241                         P.O. Box 9532                             Fraud Victim Assistance Division
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                  Allen, TX 75013                           P.O. Box 6790
877-478-7625; www.equifax.com           888-397-3742; www.experian.com            Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                                  800-680-7289; www.transunion.com
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit
can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed
to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors
and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit
freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze
laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to
$20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each
credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three
major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.
