This letter is in reference to your credit card ending in: _____.

Dear [Name],

I am writing to let you know of a security incident occurring between April 9, 2012, and June 12, 2012,
involving our website, www.ThePartsBin.com. Due to this incident, we have reason to believe that your
name and credit card information may have been accessed without authorization.

We have taken several steps to protect customer information since the discovery of this incident. We
have added extra security to ThePartsBin.com site and servers to prevent similar attacks from occurring.
We have notified law enforcement, and we are continuing to investigate the incident. We have also
informed the payment networks and credit reporting agencies so that they may take appropriate action.

Even though to date we have not received any reports of misuse of information, we recommend that you
monitor your financial accounts and credit reports for fraudulent transactions. Please consider contacting
the credit reporting agencies if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or obtain a free copy of your credit
report. If you see anything you do not recognize or understand, call the credit agency’s number listed on
the report. Examples of suspicious activity include accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors you
did not initiate, or an inaccurate home address or Social Security Number. Contact information for the
credit reporting agencies is below should you have questions about fraud alerts or need help reading your
credit report. You can protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft with respect to your credit card
information by immediately contacting your credit card issuer to close, freeze, or re-issue your account.
