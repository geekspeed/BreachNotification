Dear [Name],

You are receiving this letter since your personal information held by Pepperdine University may have been
compromised. On November 12, 2012, we discovered that a University laptop computer was stolen from an
employee’s locked car. After analyzing the data that was contained on this password protected laptop, we believe that
your personal information may have been included. The compromised personal information may include your name
and one or more of the following: Social Security number, addresses or date of birth.

I apologize for this unfortunate incident. In light of this theft, the University has contracted with ID Experts to
provide you with FraudStop Credit Edition services free of charge. ID Experts services will include: 12 months of
credit monitoring, a $20,000 insurance reimbursement policy, exclusive educational materials and access to fraud

The risks of identity theft or loss are on the rise in our increasingly “wired” world, and the University is not immune
to these risks. This is especially true with the increased use of personal electronic devices, remote-access computing
and growth in data creation and storage. As such, the University is more vulnerable to the increasing risks of data
loss and identity theft. We take these risks very seriously and are re-doubling our efforts to address all known
information security concerns to help reduce these risks in the future.

Please contact 1-877-580-9770 or go to the informational website at www.myidcare.com/PepSecurityAssistance for
any questions or concerns you may have. International callers please call 1-503-597-7714. We again want to reiterate
our deep regret that this has happened.

Sincerely,




Paul B. Lasiter
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

                                   Recommended Steps to help Protect your Identity

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, please follow the
instructions below to place the alert.

1.	 Website. Go to www.myidcare.com/PepSecurityAssistance and follow the instructions for enrollment. Once you
    have completed your enrollment, you will receive a welcome letter by email (or by mail if you do not provide
    an email address when you sign up). The welcome letter will direct you to the exclusive ID Experts’ Member
    Website where you will find other valuable educational information.

2.	 Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your membership with ID Experts, which is paid for by
    Pepperdine University. Credit monitoring is included in the membership, but you must personally activate it for
    it to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this
    service. If you need assistance, ID Experts will assist you.

3.	 Telephone. Contact ID Experts at 1-877-580-9770 or for International callers please call 1-503-597-7714 to gain
    additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate
    steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4.	 Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and
    monitoring credit reports. You can receive free credit reports by placing fraud alerts. Under federal law, you also
    are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting
    companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You
    may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four
    months.

      If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with ID Experts, notify them immediately by calling or
      by visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.

      If you file a theft report with ID Experts, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who
      will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity
      theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Experts Recovery Advocate who will work on
      your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly.

      You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note
      that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need
      to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent
      items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5.	 Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit
    bureaus by phone and also via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain
    procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For
    that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The
    contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

      Credit Bureaus

      Equifax Fraud Reporting                  Experian Fraud Reporting                  TransUnion Fraud Reporting
      1-800-525-6285                           1-888-397-3742                            1-800-680-7289
      P.O. Box 740241                          P.O. Box 9554                             Fraud Victim Assistance Division
      Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                   Allen, TX 75013                           P.O. Box 6790
      www.alerts.equifax.com                   www.experian.com                          Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                                         www.transunion.com

      It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the
      three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will
      receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for
      your review.

6.	 Security Freeze. By placing a freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information
    will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to
    contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that
    when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card
    until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state
    you live in and for each credit reporting agency. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a
    report with your local law enforcement agency or submitted an ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade
    Commission, there may be no charge to place the freeze.
