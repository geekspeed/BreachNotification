Dear _______________________
This letter is to provide you notice on behalf of Weyerhaeuser that your personal information may have been
affected by the Premera Blue Cross security breach.
WHAT HAPPENED?
On March 17, 2015, Premera notified Weyerhaeuser and others that cyber-attackers had gained unauthorized access to
Premera’s Information Technology (IT) systems since as early as May of 2014. Premera discovered the unauthorized
access on January 29, 2015. Premera’s investigation determined that the attackers may have gained unauthorized
access to information on Weyerhaeuser enrollees in Premera health plans, dating back to 2005. Premera says the
information accessed may include name, date of birth, address, email address, telephone number, Social Security
number, member identification number, and claims information, including clinical information.
Premera says it has no evidence at this time that any data was removed at any point during this security breach of
Premera’s IT systems. Premera also says it has no evidence such data has been used inappropriately since the
security breach of Premera’s IT systems. However, because personal information may have been accessed,
Premera also began mailing letters to affected individuals on March 18, 2015. Premera has also indicated that it
has cleansed its IT systems and taken steps to strengthen and enhance its security going forward.

began mailing notification letters to affected members on March 18, 2015. If you do not receive a letter from

                                                                                           8606_Notice to Premera members 03/2015
4. Place a fraud alert: Consider placing a “fraud alert” on your records with credit reporting companies. This will
   require credit reporting companies to take extra precautions if they are contacted about you by others. The
   three major credit reporting companies are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

      Equifax                           Experian                                 TransUnion
      1-800-525-6285                    1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                1-800-680-7289
      www.equifax.com                   www.experian.com                         www.transunion.com
      P.O. Box 740241                   P.O. Box 9532                            P.O. Box 6790
      Atlanta, GA 30374-0241            Allen, TX 75013                          Fullerton, CA 92834-6790

5. Don’t fall for scams: Be alert for potential scam emails, phone calls and letters that may ramp up in the wake
   of this incident. Premera says it will not email you or make unsolicited phone calls to you about this data
   security breach. Regardless of this situation, you should never provide personal information in response to
   emails or phone calls for any reason, no matter how convincing they may seem.

6. Watch for tax fraud: Be alert when filing your income tax returns. With the types of data that were exposed, it
   is possible for these cyber-criminals to file a fraudulent income tax return in your name. If a fraudulent return is
   filed before you file your income tax return, your return may be rejected and you will need to work with the IRS
   to prove that the other return was fraudulent.

7. Request a credit report annually: Under federal law, the three major credit reporting companies mentioned
   above are each required to provide you with a free copy of your credit report once per year. You can contact
   those companies directly or go to www.AnnualCreditReport.com.

8. Visit the Federal Trade Commission website or the Attorney General website in your state: Additional
   information about protecting yourself against fraud and identity theft can be found at
   http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft or at the website of your state’s Attorney
   General. You can also contact the FTC by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338) or in writing at FTC Identity
   Theft Clearinghouse, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

9. Report Any Misuse of your Personal Information: If you have any reason to believe your information is being
   misused, contact law enforcement and file a police report. Provide a copy of the police report to your creditors
   to assist them in resolving any fraudulent activity. You can also contact the attorney general of your state and
   the Federal Trade Commission to report identity theft.

We deeply regret any inconvenience or concern that this breach of Premera’s IT systems may cause you. If you
have additional questions or concerns, please contact Premera at 1-800-768-5817 or Weyerhaeuser’s Employee
Service Center at 800-833-0030.


Sincerely,



Sharon Dusek
