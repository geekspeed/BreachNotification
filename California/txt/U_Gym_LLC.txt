 •      Fraud Alert
   We recommend placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your
credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and
requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on
your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information
is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

 •      Credit Report Monitoring

     You may enroll in a credit monitoring service such as Identify Guard, Identity Source or Lifelock.

 •      Security Freeze
   In some US states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit
from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the
freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without
your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You
must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. Additionally, if
you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $5 to place, lift or
remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer
reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date
of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill,
bank statement or insurance statement.
 •   Additional Free Resources on Identity Theft

You may wish to review the tips provided by the Federal Trade Commission on how to avoid identity theft.
For more information, please visit http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). A copy
of Taking Charge: What to Do if Your Identity is Stolen, a comprehensive guide from the FTC to help you
guard against and deal with identity theft, can be found on the FTC’s website at
