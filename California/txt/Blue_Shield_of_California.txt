Dear Sample A Sample,
I am writing on behalf of Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) to advise you of a recent incident that resulted in our
disclosure of your Blue Shield Agent ID number to one or more of your clients who may have attempted to pay for their
Individual and Family Plan policy through our online payment system. The Agent ID number is your Tax Identification
Number which, in your case, is your Social Security Number (SSN). We have no reason to believe that your personal
information has been misused, but we apologize for this incident and regret the concern or inconvenience it may cause
you. The details of the incident and the steps we have taken to address it are described below.
On January 15, 2014, Blue Shield received a report that a transaction confirmation page on our website for Individual
and Family Plan members (the Website) was displaying Agent ID numbers that were, in some cases, the agents SSNs.
The Website page shows billing, payment, and other account information associated with an applicant/policyholders
Blue Shield account. Blue Shield uses the agents name and Agent ID number as a means of associating agents with                   0123456


their clients to facilitate record keeping and policy administration. The transaction confirmation pages containing your
Agent ID number/SSN were displayed to those of your clients who applied and/or paid for Blue Shield coverage through
the Website between December 20, 2013 and January 16, 2014. The Agent ID number was not presented in a format
that would suggest that it was an SSN (that is, it did not include dashes or spaces that align to the standard
000-00-0000 SSN format). Therefore, the fact that the Agent ID number was an SSN would not have been readily
apparent to your clients.
Upon receiving this report, Blue Shield took immediate steps to remove the display of the Agent ID number from the
Website, which was fully completed by January 16, 2014. In order to ensure that this issue does not recur, we are also
taking steps to improve our procedures for verifying the information that may be displayed on our Website.
We have no reason to believe that your personal information has been misused. However, we would like to help you to
protect yourself against potential misuse by offering you a free one-year membership in Experians ProtectMyIDTM
Alert. This product, which is described below, helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides
you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID
is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score.
You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and
monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect fraud, be
sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) or law enforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself
from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTCs website, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, call the FTC, at (877)
IDTHEFT (438-4338), or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW, Washington, DC 20580.




                                                                                                                              98368-LV1
                                                                                                                                         0123456


You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover
information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting
agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free
copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain
a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may
contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:
Equifax (800) 525-6285              Experian (888) 397-3742             TransUnion (800) 680-7289
P.O. Box 740241                     P.O. Box 9532                       Fraud Victim Assistance
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241              Allen, TX 75013                     Division P.O. Box 6790
www.equifax.com                     www.experian.com                    Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                        www.transunion.com
In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security
freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can
make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to
protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just
one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it
will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.
