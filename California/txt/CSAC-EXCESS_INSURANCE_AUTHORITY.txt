                                                                                                        00000009 ● ESNMMA201510 ● IBC.WFD ● 011156
                             MORE INFORMATION ON WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF
We recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free
credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months
from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report please visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting
companies is as follows:
          Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
          Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
          TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800
If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you
should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General’s office in your state. Contact
information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:
          Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center,
          600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580,
          1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft
You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information
about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report.
Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.
Note that pursuant to Massachusetts law, you have the right to obtain a copy of any police report. Massachusetts law allows
consumers to request a security freeze. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information
from your credit report without written authorization. Be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay,
interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing,
or other services.
The fee for placing a security freeze on a credit report is $5.00. If you are a victim of identity theft and submit a valid
investigative report or complaint with a law enforcement agency, the fee will be waived. In all other instances, a credit
reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. If you
have not been a victim of identity theft, you will need to include payment to the credit agency to place, lift, or remove a security
freeze by check, money order, or credit card.
To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major reporting agencies by
regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:
          Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
          Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
          TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800
In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:
      l  Your full name (including middle initial, and Jr., Sr., II., etc.)
       l Social Security number
       l Birth date
       l If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you lived over the time period.
       l Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill
       l A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver’s license or ID card, military identification,
         etc.)
The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit
report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a
unique personal identification number (“PIN”) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting
of the security freeze.
To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must call or send a
written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, address, social security number)
and the PIN or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or
individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The
credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security freeze for those identified
entities or for the specified period of time.
To remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail and include proper
identification (name, address, social security number) and the PIN or password provided to you when you placed the security
freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove the security freeze.

             protecting information provided by individuals, CSAC-EIA is writing to inform you of an incident involving information
             associated with a claim you have/had with .
             Systema Software is a third party service provider to CSAC-EIA that provides and hosts a website application for claims
             management. Systema Software notified CSAC-EIA on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
             Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
             temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for the
             application and eliminate the issue. After hearing about the researcher’s access and learning that Systema Software had
             corrected the issue, CSAC-EIA immediately began an investigation of the report and confirmed that Systema Software had
             hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and to determine the extent of the access.
             Systema Software confirmed that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user to access the databases. The
             security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and self-reported this issue. The Texas
             Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security researcher who stated under oath that:
             (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the
             external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he turned over contains the only copy of the
             information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any unauthorized use of the information.
             Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the databases
             was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of this incident and
             the information regarding your claim that was in the database, which includes your name, social security number, and
             medical information related to your claim.
             We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have further questions, please contact us at 1-866-264-1049,
             Monday through Friday, 9:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

             Dear :
             CSAC-Excess Insurance Authority (CSAC-EIA) is an insurance risk sharing program for California public entities, such as
             counties, cities, and school districts. CSAC-EIA provides excess insurance coverage to its members when individuals bring
             worker’s compensation, general liability, or medical malpractice claims against the member. Because of the importance of
             protecting information provided by individuals, CSAC-EIA is writing to inform you of an incident involving information
             associated with a claim you have/had with .
             Systema Software is a third party service provider to CSAC-EIA that provides and hosts a website application for claims
             management. Systema Software notified CSAC-EIA on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
             Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
             temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for the
             application and eliminate the issue. After hearing about the researcher’s access and learning that Systema Software had
             corrected the issue, CSAC-EIA immediately began an investigation of the report and confirmed that Systema Software had
             hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and to determine the extent of the access.
             Systema Software confirmed that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user to access the databases. The
             security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and self-reported this issue. The Texas
             Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security researcher who stated under oath that:
             (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the
             external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he turned over contains the only copy of the
             information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any unauthorized use of the information.
             Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the databases
             was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of this incident and
             the information regarding your claim that was in the database, which includes your name, social security number, and
             medical information related to your claim.
             We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have further questions, please contact us at 1-866-264-1049,
             Monday through Friday, 9:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

             Dear Estate of :
             CSAC-Excess Insurance Authority (CSAC-EIA) is an insurance risk sharing program for California public entities, such as
             counties, cities, and school districts. CSAC-EIA provides excess insurance coverage to its members when individuals bring
             worker’s compensation, general liability, or medical malpractice claims against the member. Because of the importance of
             protecting information provided by individuals, CSAC-EIA is writing to inform you of an incident involving information
             associated with a claim with .
             Systema Software is a third party service provider to CSAC-EIA that provides and hosts a website application for claims
             management. Systema Software notified CSAC-EIA on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
             Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
             temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for the
             application and eliminate the issue. After hearing about the researcher’s access and learning that Systema Software had
             corrected the issue, CSAC-EIA immediately began an investigation of the report and confirmed that Systema Software had
             hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and to determine the extent of the access.
             Systema Software confirmed that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user to access the databases. The
             security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and self-reported this issue. The Texas
             Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security researcher who stated under oath that:
             (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the
             external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he turned over contains the only copy of the
             information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any unauthorized use of the information.
             Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the databases
             was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of this incident and
             the information regarding the claim that was in the database, which includes the name and medical information related to
             the person who made the claim.
             We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have further questions, please contact us at 1-866-264-1049,
             Monday through Friday, 9:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.

             counties, cities, and school districts. CSAC-EIA provides excess insurance coverage to its members when individuals bring
             worker’s compensation, general liability, or medical malpractice claims against the member. Because of the importance of
             protecting information provided by individuals, CSAC-EIA is writing to inform you of an incident involving information
             associated with a claim with .
             Systema Software is a third party service provider to CSAC-EIA that provides and hosts a website application for claims
             management. Systema Software notified CSAC-EIA on September 9, 2015, that a security researcher contacted Systema
             Software because he had identified a configuration in the website application that allowed him to gain access to a
             temporary data backup of claims databases. Systema Software was able to immediately correct the permissions for the
             application and eliminate the issue. After hearing about the researcher’s access and learning that Systema Software had
             corrected the issue, CSAC-EIA immediately began an investigation of the report and confirmed that Systema Software had
             hired a computer security firm to ensure that the configuration issue was corrected and to determine the extent of the access.
             Systema Software confirmed that the security researcher was the only unauthorized user to access the databases. The
             security researcher, who lives in Texas, also contacted the Texas Attorney General and self-reported this issue. The Texas
             Attorney General investigated the report and obtained an affidavit from the security researcher who stated under oath that:
             (1) he downloaded information from Systema Software’s website application to an external hard drive; (2) he delivered the
             external hard drive to the Texas Attorney General; (3) the hard drive he turned over contains the only copy of the
             information he downloaded; and (4) he has not and will not engage in any unauthorized use of the information.
             Based on the investigation and the researcher’s sworn statement, we do not believe that any information from the databases
             was used for any unauthorized purpose. However, we wanted to let you know about our investigation of this incident and
             the information regarding the claim that was in the database, which includes the name and social security number of the
             person who made the claim.
             We regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have further questions, please contact us at 1-866-264-1049,
             Monday through Friday, 9:00 am – 6:00 pm PST.
