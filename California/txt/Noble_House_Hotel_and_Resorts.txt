Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:
Noble House Hotels and Resorts (Noble House) values the relationship we have with our guests and understands the
importance of protecting your personal information. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may involve
some of your information.
Noble House began an investigation after we received calls from some of our guests who saw unauthorized charges
on their payment cards used at one of our hotels, The Commons. We notified the FBI regarding the incident. We
engaged a computer security firm to examine our payment system for any signs of an issue. The computer security
firm identified malware on the payment card system for The Commons on September 25, 2015. The information
potentially compromised by the malware included data found in the magnetic stripe on payment cards, which includes
the cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV number. Based on the ongoing investigation, it is
possible that payment cards used at The Commons from January 28, 2015 to August 3, 2015 may have been affected.
We are notifying you about this incident so you can take appropriate steps to protect your payment card account.
We recommend that you remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account
statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your financial
institution because the major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for
fraudulent charges that are reported in a timely manner.
If you incurred costs that your financial institution declined to reimburse related to fraudulent charges on a payment
card you used at The Commons, please contact us at the number below. We will reimburse you for any such reasonable,
documented costs that your financial institution declined to pay.
We regret any inconvenience or concern this may have caused. To help prevent this from happening again, we have
been working with the computer security firm to review our security measures, ensure that this issue has been fully
remediated, and look for ways to enhance our security measures. If you have any questions, or you need further
assistance, please call (888) 287-9902, Monday through Friday between the hours of 9:00 am and 9:00 pm EST.
Sincerely,




Duane Rohrbaugh
General Manager, The Commons Hotel

                                More Information About Ways to Protect Yourself

We recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report
from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online
at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request
Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta,
GA, 30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national
credit reporting agencies listed below.

            Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
            Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
            TransUnion, PO Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022 www. transunion.com, 1-800-888-4213

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should
promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities,
including local law enforcement, your state’s attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
You may contact the FTC or your state’s regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and
protection against identity theft: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft. Please note that this notice was not
delayed because of a law enforcement investigation.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors
on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud
alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An
initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit
report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud
alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any
of the three national credit reporting agencies at the toll-free numbers listed below:

Equifax                                 Experian                                 TransUnion
877-478-7625                            888-397-3742                             800-680-7289

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file,
so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get
access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws
vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state,
generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a
credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit
freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified above to find
out more information.

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national
credit reporting agencies listed above.
