identity theft.

For residents of Massachusetts and West Virginia.
You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting any of the credit bureaus
listed at the top of this page. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being
approved in your name without your consent.
To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may be able to use an online process, an automated
telephone line or a written request. The following information must be included when requesting a security
freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for
him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of
birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident
report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also
include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance
statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the
date of issue. The consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove
a freeze and free if you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have
submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer reporting agency.
