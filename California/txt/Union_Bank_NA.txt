                                           What Other Actions Can You Take?
          •	 Carefully monitor all your bank account statements and other financial records for any
             unauthorized activity.
          •	 If you choose not to take advantage of the free credit monitoring service, consider obtaining an
             annual free copy of your credit reports by visiting annualcreditreport.com or calling 1-877-322-8228.
          •	 You may also choose to place a “fraud alert” on your credit file. You can do this by contacting any of the
             credit bureaus listed below. Be aware, however, that adding a fraud alert may potentially cause a delay in
             the granting of any new credit. Also, if you plan on signing up for the complimentary service outlined on
             the previous page, we recommend that you don’t place a fraud alert until after enrollment because it can
             delay the receipt of your membership materials.
