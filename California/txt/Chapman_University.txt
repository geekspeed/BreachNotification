                   Dear :
                   On February 27, 2013 Chapman University officials learned that certain electronic documents containing




                                                                              E
                   personal information could have been viewed by authenticated users of the Chapman University system. These
                   documents were never available to the general public, and only authenticated users of the on-campus network
                   who were logged into the system could have accessed them. As a precautionary measure you are being notified
                   of this matter.


                                                                           PL
                   The university‚Äôs Department of Information Systems and Technology discovered this vulnerability during
                   standard security testing and the documents were immediately blocked from access by unauthorized users. Some
                   of these documents contained names, social security numbers, student identification numbers and dates of birth.
                   We are notifying you of this incident because you are one of the individuals whose personal information was
                   included in these documents. While we have no evidence that an unauthorized individual accessed your personal
                   data, we are notifying you so you can be especially alert to any signs of possible misuse of your personal
                   identity. We want to make you aware of steps you can take to guard against identity theft or fraud. Please review
                   the enclosed Information about Identity Theft Protection, including information about how to place a fraud alert
                     M
                   on your consumer credit file. Additional information about identify theft can be obtained from the California
                   Office of Privacy Protection at http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov/.
                   To help safeguard you from misuse of your personal information, we have arranged for identity monitoring
                   within the United States for 12 months at no cost to you. While we believe there is little likelihood that your
                   information will be misused as a result of this incident, you can enroll in a professional identity monitoring
                   service (First Watch ID) provided by First Watch Technologies, Inc. To enroll in this service, simply call
                   SA

                   877-817-0173 from 9a.m. to 7p.m. (Eastern Time) or go to www.firstwatchid.com and:
                   ‚Ä¢          Click on ‚Äúverification code‚Äù on the upper right-hand corner of the First Watch ID homepage.
                   ‚Ä¢          Enter the appropriate information including this unique 9-digit verification code .
                   You can sign up for this service anytime between now and July 12, 2013 using the verification code listed
                   above.
                   Once you have enrolled, you will receive one year of proactive identity monitoring. First Watch ID will monitor
                   thousands of databases and billions of records on your behalf to look for suspicious activity that could indicate
                   the beginning steps of identity theft. If suspicious activity is found, First Watch will place a personal phone call
                   to you (at the telephone number that you provide) to determine if the suspicious activity is fraudulent. The First
                   Watch ID service also includes up to $25,000 of identity theft insurance with $0 deductible, along with identity
                   restoration coverage (certain limitations and exclusions may apply).
                   Additionally, if you enroll, First Watch provides you with easy online access to monitor your credit activity
                   using the three major credit bureau services. Each credit bureau will provide you one free credit report annually.
                   First Watch suggests you request your free credit report from one bureau at a time every four months. This
                   allows you to monitor credit activity three times per year. First Watch will send you an email (at the email
                   address you provide) every four months reminding you to request your free credit report from the appropriate
                   bureau.

Chapman University is committed to safeguarding the privacy of personal information and takes many
precautions for the security of such information. We have already taken measures designed to prevent this from
happening again in the future. In this instance, the university corrected access privileges to these documents
immediately after the discovery. Additionally, we are in the process of enhancing our security-protocol training
and implementing additional software-related safeguards.
While no evidence exists that any personal information was accessed, as a precaution we recommend you
carefully check your credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries from creditors you did not
initiate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. If you find any
suspicious activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriff‚Äôs office.
Chapman has arranged for you to receive assistance with any concerns or questions you may have at this time.

                   to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records.

                   Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your

                   initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of
                   identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended
                   alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate
                   documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit
file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you
when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your
credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will
not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit
freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a
credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing
a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a
fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since
the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit
reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.
