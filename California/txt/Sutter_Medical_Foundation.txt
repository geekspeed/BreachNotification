Dear Sample A Sample:
I am writing to notify you that, as part of an investigation, we reviewed a former employees email activity and
access to computer systems. On August 27, 2015, we determined that the former employee emailed certain
electronic documents to a personal email address without authorization on April 26, 2013.
Your information was included in one or more of these electronic documents. The information included your
name, date of birth, insurance identification number, date of service and billing code. The information did not
include Social Security numbers, California issued identification numbers, credit card or bank account numbers.
While the information in the electronic documents is very limited, because we do not know if the information in
the emailed electronic documents was viewed or used, we are offering you a free one-year membership in
Experians ProtectMyID Alert to provide you with credit monitoring capabilities and assistance in identity theft
protection. For more information on ProtectMyID Alert and instructions on how to activate your complimentary
one-year membership, please see the reverse side of this letter.
We continue to investigate this incident and are working with law enforcement. We apologize for any concerns
or inconvenience this may cause and have set up a special toll-free number to help answer your questions. You
may call (877) 235-0796, Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. When prompted, please
enter the following 10 digit reference number: 2456090915.
Sincerely,



Jacki Monson
Chief Privacy Officer                                                                                                    0123456

                                                                                                                                              B3245-L03
               ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO HELP REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT
Þ PLACE A 90-DAY FRAUD ALERT ON YOUR CREDIT FILE
An initial 90 day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a
victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the
credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps
to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be
satisfied. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.
             Equifax                            Experian                         TransUnion
         1-800-525-6285                    1-888-397-3742                     1-800-680-7289
        www.equifax.com                   www.experian.com                  www.transunion.com
Þ   PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT FILE
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right
for you. Placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit
report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. With a Security Freeze in place, you will be
required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. This process is also completed
through each of the credit reporting companies.
Þ   ORDER YOUR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORTS
Visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit reports, review them
for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not
authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact
the credit reporting company.
Þ   MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Take steps such as: carrying only essential documents with you; being aware of whom you are sharing your
personal information with and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.
Þ   USE TOOLS FROM CREDIT PROVIDERS
Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card and other account statements. Be proactive and
create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or
suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local
police and contact a credit reporting company.
