Next Day Flyers is committed to delivering top-quality printed marketing materials to all businesses,
no matter their size, with one of the fastest turnaround times in the industry. In connection with best
serving our customers, we recognize the importance of, and are highly committed to, securing the
privacy and confidentiality of the personal information provided to us. Regrettably, we are writing
to inform you of an incident involving that information.


On April 2, 2012, we discovered an electronic file on our system that was storing transaction
information, including the name, address, e-mail address, and credit card information for customers
who placed orders through our website between March 23, 2012 and April 2, 2012. We do not know
if any unauthorized person accessed this file or how the file was created, but we detected the file
near the time an unauthorized person was tring to disrupt traffic to our website. We removed the file
immediately, and we updated our system to guard against a similar event in the future and prevent
transaction information from being copied to a temporary file.


Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of the incident and have arranged for your
self-enrollment, in a one-year membership in ProtectMyIDTM Alert from Experian. At no cost to
you, this will provide comprehensive credit monitoring capabilities and identity-theft insurance.
You can enroll in ProtectMyID.com without affecting your credit score. The steps and process for
signing up for this service are included with this letter.


Even if you choose not to take advantage of this free credit monitoring service, we recommend that
you remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your credit report and
credit card, bank, and other financial statements for any unauthorized activity. You may also obtain
a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide
credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report please visit
