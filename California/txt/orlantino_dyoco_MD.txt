Re:    Breach Notification

Dear Valued Patient:

Our office represents the office of Olartino Dyoco, M.D.. We want to assure you that the
security, confidentiality, integrity and privacy of patient personal information are highly valued
by Dr. Dyoco. We are writing you because of a possible disclosure of your personally
identifiable information.

On June 2, 2015, Dr. Dyoco opened his office and found the office had been
burglarized. Several computers had been stolen, containing patient information used
for billing, which included:

Names and addresses                  Birth dates            telephone numbers
Insurance numbers                    treatment codes        billing information

Dr. Dyoco reported this to the Fresno Police Department, report number 15-38894.

The circumstances that resulted in this breach were unforeseeable, and Dr. Dyoco
assures you that he has heightened procedures and safeguards to prevent a
recurrence of this situation. He added levels of encryption to his computer systems,
and advised his staff with regard to security training anything to avoid this situation in
the future.

Dr. Dyoco again sincerely apologizes for this breach of protected personal and health
information. If you have any questions concerning this breach, please contact the
attorney listed below. Our toll free telephone number is (888) 233-2305.

Very truly yours,
