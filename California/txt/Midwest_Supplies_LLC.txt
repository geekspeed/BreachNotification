Dear Fellow Homebrewer.


We’re writing to tell you that it’s possible that the credit card you used at Midwest Supplies on [Month, Day, Year] might have
been compromised at that time. Despite our best efforts, the security of our website was breached by an outside party. Your
credit card information might have been improperly viewed including your name, address, email address, telephone number,
credit card number, expiration date and security code.


As soon as we discovered the breach, we took immediate measures to resolve the situation and are satisfied that it is, in fact,
resolved. We conducted a full investigation and have taken extensive steps to prevent it from happening again.


You should carefully monitor your monthly credit card statements for unusual charges. Be advised that if you see charges that
you believe are suspect, you should immediately contact your credit card company directly. For additional information about
how to protect yourself in situations such as these, please see the other side of this letter.


We know that this situation is inconvenient and creates unnecessary worry and concern. Feel free to call us directly at
1-888-449-2739 if you have any questions.


In the meantime we’d like to offer you our sincere apologies. We take privacy and security very seriously.


We’ve spent many years working to earn your trust and loyalty. And we recognize that an attack on us like this can undermine
that trust. As one homebrewer to another, you can rest assured that we won’t rest until you’ve brewed your best. Let’s help you
do just that … please accept this $25 coupon, reference code [SY-XXXXXX] as a gesture of apology for the inconvenience you
might have experienced.
