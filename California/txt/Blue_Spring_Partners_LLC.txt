Dear <<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>>,
We are writing to tell you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information.
We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. That is why we are contacting you directly
to let you know how we are protecting you personally. Our company is founded on a commitment to absolute
customer service, satisfaction, and integrity therefore this is a very difficult letter for us to write and we sincerely
apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause you.

What Happened?
On April 30, 2015, we detected a system intrusion that occurred on April 25, 2015. Your personal information may
have been disclosed which included name, address, email and encrypted password. We immediately implemented
procedures to protect all data and prevent unauthorized access and requested an investigation with authorities.
After a detailed review of our shopping cart system, on May 14, 2015, it was further discovered that malware (malicious
computer code) had been installed on our server checkout page at our company website, finfunmermaid.com, by an
unauthorized individual or entity, which compromised customer data and payment details. According to our records,
you made a payment card purchase during the time our site was vulnerable, so we believe your information may be
at risk.
The payment card data that we discovered was comprised of customer name, address, email, password, credit card
account number, card expiration date, and security code.
Our site is now secure and enhanced security measures have been implemented to prevent similar attempts in the
future. We have engaged cyber security experts to commence an investigation. We have contacted the FBI and are
working with authorities. We are providing this notice so that you can take steps to help protect your information
from unauthorized use, such as the steps detailed in the enclosed state notification requirements.

What Are We Doing To Protect You?
To help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to
provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and
