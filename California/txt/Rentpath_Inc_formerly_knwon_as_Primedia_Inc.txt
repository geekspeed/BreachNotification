 Dear     `_ __
 We recently discovered a security incident that occurred at our offices which may have resulted in
 the exposure of some of your personal information. At this time, we are not aware of any misuse of
 your personal information. We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and
 sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.
 We recently experienced the theft of over fifty pieces of computer hardware from our facilities. Upon
 investigating this event, we learned that three computer storage devices were among those stolen.
 Although the devices were not encrypted, they were password protected. At that time, we attempted
 to discover what information was on the devices by restoring the backup tapes. Unfortunately, the
 backup tapes were corrupted. We then retained an expert company specializing in computer forensics,
 which successfully restored the tapes and then conducted an analysis on the data. On March 6, 2013,
 following forensic analysis, we learned that one of the devices contained your name, Social Security
 number, and may have contained limited financial information.
 We believe that the goal of the perpetrator was to sell the hardware for quick cash. We do not believe
 he was interested in the data contained on the devices. The person responsible has been identified
 and arrested. We want to make you aware of this situation even though we believe it is unlikely that
 your information has been or will be misused.

 We have also taken measures to prevent this type of event from happening again, including updating
 our data retention policies, increasing the security of our data storage devices, including the use of
 encryption technology, and increasing physical security at our facilities.

 As stated above, we are not aware of any misuse of your information. However, out of an abundance
 of caution, we have engaged the services of Kroll Advisory Solutions to provide identity theft safeguards
 at no cost to you through its IDTheftSmart'"' program. Kroll Advisory Solutions is a global leader in
 risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have
