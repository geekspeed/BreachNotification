                  Important security update regarding
                                                                                             Important Security Update Regarding
                  your Rewards"R"Us account
                                                                                             Your Rewards“R”Us Account
                  Membership Number:

                  Toys"R"Us has many layers of account security in place to keep
                  your Rewards"R'Us account balance and other profile
                  information safe. Recently, because of mechanisms in place to
                  alert us to potential efforts to overcome that security, we
                  identified an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a small
                  percentage of Rewards"R"Us accounts from 1/28/15-1/30/15.
                  We suspect this activity was due to large breaches at other
                  companies (not Toys"R"Us), where user login names and
                  passwords were stolen and then used for unauthorized access to
                  other accounts, such as Rewards"R"Us accounts where a user
                  may use the same login name and/or password. It appears that
                  your Rewards"R"Us account may have been accessed during
                  this time frame by individuals who may have obtained your
                  account password from another source or successfully guessed
                  it. Out of an abundance of caution, we are therefore treating your
                  account password as compromised and taking appropriate steps
                  to address that situation.

                  Protecting your member account:
                  Because of our commitment to ensure high security standards.
                  we have implemented a number of additional procedures to
                  further protect the accounts of our members. As part of these
                  incremental measures, we have forced a hard reset of your
                  password, which prevents access to your account until it has
                  been reset by you using an email address that was created prior
                  to January 28. 2015.

                  How to reset your Rewards"R"Us password:

                   1. Go to httos://rewardsrus.toysrus.com and select "Forgot
                      Password?"
                   2. Enter your Membership # and the email address that you
                      used to access your account prior to January 28, 2015 and
                      click "Submit". If you lost or forgot your Membership # click
                      on "Forgot Membership tr" for help, and if you no longer
                      have access to your pre-January 28 email address, please
                      contact us at 1-800-TOYSRUS.
                   3. Answer the security question and create your new
                      password.
                         • We recommend a complex password that includes a
                           mix of letters, numbers and symbols. Do not reuse
                           a password or one that you use at other sites.
                   4. A pop-up window will appear upon a successful password
                      change.
                   5. Log out and verify your new password is working properly.

                  Your "R"Us Reward Dollars:
                  We see that "R"Lls Reward Dollars from your account were
                  printed from 1/28/15-1/30/15. You may have printed these
                  Reward Dollars yourself, but regardless, we will be reinstating
                  points equal to the amount printed during this lime frame. Please
                  note, these rewards can be accessed via the Rewards"R"Us
                  website as of 2/28/15.

                  Account security best practices:
                  Your password is the first line of defense when it comes to
                  safeguarding all of your online accounts.

                    • As mentioned above, create a complex password that
                      includes a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.
                    • Avoid using the same password across multiple online
                      accounts or a password that you have used in the past.
                    • Change your password on a regular basis.
                    • Check your account from time to time and notify us of any
                      account changes.

                  We would like to assure you that the security of our member
                  information remains our highest priority. If you should have any
                  questions, please contact us at 1-800-TOYSRUS.

                  to your Rewards "R" Us account, then information in your
                  Geoffrey's Birthday Club account may have been accessed as
                  well. Out of an abundance of caution, we are therefore treating

                  Important security update regarding
                  your Rewards"R"Us account and
                                                                                        Important Security Update Regarding

                  Membership Number:

                  Toys"R"Us has many layers of account security in place to keep
                  your Rewards"R"Us account balance and other profile
                  information safe. Recently, because of mechanisms in place to
                  alert us to potential efforts to overcome that security, we
                  identified an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a small
                  percentage of Rewards"R"Us accounts from 1/28/15-1/30/15.
                  We suspect this activity was due to large breaches at other
                  companies (not Toys"R"Us), where user login names and
                  passwords were stolen and then used for unauthorized access to
                  other accounts, such as Rewards"R"Us accounts where a user
                  may use the same login name and/or password. It appears that
                  your Rewards"R"Us account may have been accessed during
                  this time frame by individuals who may have obtained your
                  account password from another source or successfully guessed
                  it. If you have a Geoffrey's Birthday Club account and it is linked
                  to your Rewards "R" Us account, then information in your
                  Geoffrey's Birthday Club account may have been accessed as
                  well. Out of an abundance of caution, we are therefore treating
                  your account password as compromised and taking appropriate
                  steps to address that situation.

                  Protecting your member account:
                  Because of our commitment to ensure high security standards.
                  we have implemented a number of additional procedures to
                  further protect the accounts of our members. As part of these
                  incremental measures, we have forced a hard reset of your
                  password, which prevents access to your account until it has
                  been reset by you using an email address that was created prior
                  to January 28, 2015.

                  How to reset your Rewards"R"Us password:

                   1. Go to https://rewardsrus.toysrus.com and select "Forgot
                      Password'?"
                   2. Enter your Membership # and the email address that you
                      used to access your account prior to January 28, 2015 and
                      click "Submit". If you lost or forgot your Membership #, click
                      on "Forgot Membership #" for help, and if you no longer
                      have access to your pre-January 28 email address, please
                      contact us at 1-800-TOYSRUS.
                   3. Answer the security question and create your new
                      password.
                         • We recommend a complex password that includes a
                           mix of letters, numbers and symbols. Do not reuse
                           a password or one that you use at other sites.
                   4. A pop-up window will appear upon a successful password
                      change.
                   5. Log out and verify your new password is working properly.

                  Your Endless Earnings e-gift card:
                  We see that purchases were made using your Endless Earnings
                  gift card, accessible from your Rewards"R"Us account from
                  1/28/15-1/30/15. You may have accessed this gift card, but
                  regardless, we will need to deactivate your current e-gift card
                  and reissue a new one in the amount equal to your balance as of
                  1/27/15. In order to successfully do this, we will contact you via
                  phone during the week of 3/2/15.

                  Account security best practices:
                  Your password is the first line of defense when it comes to
                  safeguarding all of your online accounts.

                    • As mentioned above, create a complex password that
                      includes a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.
                    • Avoid using the same password across multiple online
                      accounts or a password that you have used in the past.
                    • Change your password on a regular basis.
                    • Check your account from time to time and notify us of any
                      account changes.

                  We would like to assure you that the security of our member
                  information remains our highest priority. If you should have any

                   breaches at other companies (not Toys"Rts) where user
                   login names and passwords were stolen and then used for
                   unauthorized access to other accounts such as Rewards"R"Us
                   accounts where a user may use the same login name andlor
                   password

                   Protecting your member account:
                   We see your account was accessed during this time frame. If
                   you have a Geoffrey's Birthday Club account and it is linked to
                   your Rewards "R" Us account. then information in your
                   Geoffrey's Birthday Club account may have been accessed as
                   well. While you may have personally logged in and we have no
                   particular reason to believe your login name or password was
                   compromised because of our commitment to ensure high
                   security standards. we have implemented a number of
                   additional procedures to further protect the accounts of our
                   members. As part of these incremental measures. we have
                   forced a hard reset of your password. which prevents access to
                   your account until It has been reset by you.
