Ref: Individual Electronic Filing Client

I am writing because of an incident that has occurred. I was informed by
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service that an electronic filing report from
my office was found by the Postal Service in a raid on a criminal who
has been arrested. This report included your name, social security number.
If you had filed a joint return, your spouse’s information was not on the report.
The Postal Service Inspector confirmed on 9-6-2012 that the list was from
my office, I have no specific date of the actual unauthorized release.

The electronic filing list is no longer being sent to the Internal Revenue Service
through the mail and our procedure has changed so we no longer produce such a
list.

Because your social security number was involved, I recommend that you place a fraud
alert on your credit file. A fraud alert requires potential creditors to use what the law
refers to as “reasonable policies and procedures” to verify your identify before issuing
credit in your name. A fraud alert lasts for 90 days. Just call one of the three credit
reporting agencies at a number below. This will let you automatically place an alert
with all of the agencies. You will receive letters from all three, confirming the fraud
alert and letting you know how to get a free copy of your credit report from each.

Equifax 1-800-525-6285         Experian 1-888-397-3742       TransUnion 1-800-680-7289

When you receive your credit reports, look them over carefully. Look for accounts
you did not open. Look for inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate. And look
for personal information, such as home address and Social Security number, that is
not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency
at the telephone number on the report. If you find suspicious activity on your credit
reports, call your local police or sheriff’s office and file a report of identity theft.

Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, we recommend that you
check your credit report periodically. You can keep the fraud alert in place by calling
again after 90 days. For more information on identity theft, I suggest you visit the
web site of the California Office of Privacy Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov.

If there is anything that we can do to assist you, please call us at 707-643-1745.

Sincerely,


Carmichael Company
