Subject: Important Security Notice About Your Wattpad Account

August 6, 2015

We need to inform you of an important matter concerning your Wattpad account. On Friday,
May 29, we identified an attack against our system. While we were able to block the attack
within hours of identification, following a review of the incident, it’s possible that some of your
information may have been accessed.

The information that may have been accessed includes your email address, Wattpad password,
Tumblr username and password, last login IP, and other user profile information you provided.
While your Wattpad password was encrypted, your Tumblr password was not stored in an
encrypted form. To see the other user profile information you provided to us, please login to
your account on the Web and go to ‘Settings’. If you are unable to gain access to your account,
please go here. The information accessed does not include stories you read or created.

The security and safety of our community is of the highest importance. As a precaution, we
recommend you promptly change your Wattpad password and your Tumblr password. If you
used the same passwords for other accounts, you should also change the password for those
accounts. As always, you should be suspicious of anyone who contacts you requesting personal
information online.

We take your online security seriously. We have already implemented additional security
measures and will continue to improve our systems to avoid future issues. Please accept our
sincerest apologies.

If you have any questions please contact us at security@wattpad.com.

Kind regards,

Marc Shewchun
Head of Community Operations
on behalf of The Wattpad Team
