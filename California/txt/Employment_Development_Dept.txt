This letter is to notify you that some of your confidential information may have been released by
the Employment Development Department (EDD) in a notice mailed to an employer for whom
you did not work. Our analysis of records shows that between September 14, 2013, and
October 9, 2013, your full name and social security number (SSN) may have been mailed to an
incorrect employer.

Employers regularly receive these claim filing notices as part of the verification required in
processing unemployment benefits and are aware that the information contained in them is
confidential. In fact, some of these notices already have been returned to the EDD by employers
noting the information on the notice does not match their records.

Enclosed is a Fact Sheet from the California Office of the Attorney General that explains the
steps you may elect to take to protect your personal information. You will also find helpful
information on their website at www.oag.ca.gov/privacy.

The EDD assures you that the cause was identified and corrected to prevent any further occurrences.

If you have any questions, you may submit your question online using Ask EDD and selecting
the Privacy topic or you may contact (916) 654-7401.

Sincerely,




CHRISTIAN TURNER
Chief Information Security Officer
