Dear [First_Name] [Last_Name],
I am writing to inform you of an unfortunate situation that has occurred which affects us all. On
Tuesday, June 24, 2014, an incident occurred in which a company-owned laptop computer containing
some of our personal information including, name, address, date of birth and Social Security number,
was stolen. We have no reason to believe that your personal information has been compromised, as the
computer in question was password protected.

                                    Exhibit A - Additional Information

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
You may wish to visit the website of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission at www.consumer.gov/idtheft or
reach the FTC at 1-877-382-4357 or 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580 for further
information about how to protect yourself from identity theft. Your state Attorney General may also
have advice on preventing identity theft.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports
closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial
institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any
fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities,
your state Attorney General, and/or the Federal Trade Commission.

To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).
Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which is a
database made available to law enforcement agencies.

FRAUD ALERTS AND SECURITY FREEZES
You may obtain information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and
security freezes. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or
change your existing accounts. A fraud alert permits creditors to get your report as long as they take
steps to verify your identity. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from
being approved in your name without your consent; however, using a security freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to send a request to each national credit
reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail. The following information
must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for
your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and
any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses
for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement
agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued
identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that
each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. The
consumer reporting agency may charge a fee (up to $5.00 for Massachusetts residents) to place a freeze
or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity
theft, and you have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the national
credit reporting agency. Visit the websites of each consumer reporting agency for more information
about placing a freeze, as they may have different requirements depending on the state in which you
reside.
