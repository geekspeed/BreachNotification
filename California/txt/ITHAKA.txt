RE: Important Security Notice from JSTOR

We are writing to let you know that your MyJSTOR account was recently accessed without
authorization by a third party.

What this means to you

This means the any personal information you have added as part of your MyJSTOR profile may
have been accessed, including your username, password, email address,
primary area of study, position/academic status, and institutional affiliation. We do not store
credit card data or financial information of any kind, so this was not accessed.

What you should do

We strongly recommend that you change the password of your MyJSTOR account, and other
accounts where you may use this password.

To change your password, log in to your account at JSTOR.org and select the "MyJSTOR" menu
at the top of the page, then scroll down and select "My Profile." Enter your old password where
prompted and select a new, secure password. The password must be a minimum of six
characters. We recommend you do the same on other sites where you use this password. For
additional help with password security, you might consider password managing applications
such as 1Password and LastPass.

We are sorry this happened and recognize that these kinds of events can be troubling. JSTOR has
over 3 million MyJSTOR accounts in total, and yours was one of only approximately 800
accounts affected by this incident. We take these situations seriously. We have taken the steps
necessary to stop this activity and are reviewing our security measures to prevent future
incidents.

Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. You can reach us at
education@jstor.org.


Thank you,

JSTOR User Services
