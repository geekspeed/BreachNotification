Dear Sample A. Sample:

The privacy and confidentiality of our clients' personal information is of the utmost importance
to Incorporating Services, Ltd. ("ISL"). Regrettably, we write to inform you of an incident
related to some of your personal information provided to us in connection with our services.

On April 2, 2012, our internet hosting vendor informed us that one of our servers was
compromised by a maiware attack. We recently completed an extensive investigation of this
incident in order to determine the scope of the attack and the individuals potentially affected.

Our investigation revealed the malicious software allowed an unauthorized party to access data
stored on the server. In some instances, this data included the Social Security numbers of
corporate officers, required to obtain an BIN for newly formed corporate entities. In this regard,
your name and Social Security number were contained on the server. However, the compromised
data did NOT contain any of your credit card, banking, or other financial account information.

To date, we are not aware of any misuse of your information or any other fraudulent activity
related to this incident. However, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you with a free
one-year membership in Experian's ProtectMylDTM Elite. This product helps detect possible
misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused
on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.
