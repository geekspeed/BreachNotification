Dear Customer:

We are writing this letter to inform you of a data security incident that involved some of your personal
information.

What Happened?

On March 10, 2016, Staminus Communications was the victim of an unauthorized intrusion into its
network. As a result of this intrusion, systems were temporarily taken offline and customer information
was exposed. The protection of the personal information of its customers is very important to Staminus.
Upon discovering this attack, Staminus took immediate action, including launching an investigation into
the attack, notifying law enforcement, restoring its systems, and putting additional security measures into
place to help prevent a future incident.

What Information Was Involved?

Based on our initial investigation, we know that names and credit card numbers, as well as usernames,
passwords, and contact information, were exposed. Staminus’ investigation into the incident is ongoing.

What Are We Doing?

In addition to the steps noted above (e.g., restoring our systems and notifying law enforcement), we have
relaunched our billing platform, partnering with leading payment processors, Stripe and Zuora. We have
also implemented multi-factor authentication requirements. We also are continuing to work with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) in its investigation of the incident. We continue to work with law
enforcement in their investigation of this breach, and our notice to you has not been delayed as a result of
any law enforcement investigation.

In addition, we have taken steps to notify credit card companies of the credit card numbers that may have
been accessed during this incident. Your credit card company may contact you to verify charges if it
detects any unusual pattern of activity, or to replace your credit card. While we have taken steps to notify
your credit card company proactively, we recommend that you also immediately notify your credit card
issuing bank and follow its advice with regard to your credit card.

What You Can Do

    •   Contact Your Credit Card Issuer. As noted, we have taken steps to notify credit card
        companies of the credit card numbers impacted. Even so, you should remain vigilant by carefully
        reviewing your credit card account statements and immediately alerting your credit card issuing
        bank of any suspicious charges. This is the most important step that you can take to detect and
        prevent any unauthorized use of your credit card number.

    •   Change Your Passwords. While the Staminus passwords compromised were hashed, it is
        possible that the decryption key was compromised as well. Thus, you should immediately change
        your Staminus password. Additionally, we highly recommend customers who utilize similar
        credentials across different platforms reset any passwords on accounts that may use the same or
        a similar password to their Staminus login.

    •   Be Aware of Phishing Schemes. You should also always be on the lookout for phishing
        schemes. Any email correspondence we may send regarding this matter will not contain a link, so
        if you receive an email appearing to be from us that contains a link, it is not from us, and you
        should not click on the link. Also, never provide sensitive information to unsolicited requests

        claiming to come from us, your bank or other organizations. We would never ask you for sensitive
        information via email.

    •   Regularly Review Your Financial Statements. We recommend you remain vigilant by regularly
        reviewing your credit card and bank account statements.

    •   Obtain a Free Credit Report. You may request a free copy of your U.S. credit report once every
        12 months by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 1-877-322-8228 toll free. You can
        print a copy of the request form at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm.

    •   Carefully Review Your Credit Report. Look for accounts you did not open and inquiries from
        creditors that you did not initiate. Also, look for personal information, such as your home address,
        that is inaccurate. If you see anything that is wrong or that you do not understand, call the credit
        reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. We also suggest that you consider
        contacting one of the major credit bureaus listed below to place a fraud alert or security freeze on
        your credit reports:

    •   Place a Security Freeze on Your Account. In addition to a fraud alert, you may also have a
        security freeze placed on your credit file. A security freeze will block a credit bureau from
        releasing information from your credit report without your prior written authorization. Please be
        aware that it may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make
        for new loans, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. The fees for placing a security
        freeze vary by state, and a consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $10.00 to place
        a freeze or lift or remove a freeze. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may send
        a written request to each of the major consumer reporting agencies by regular, certified, or
        overnight mail. You can also place security freezes online by visiting each consumer reporting
        agency online.
