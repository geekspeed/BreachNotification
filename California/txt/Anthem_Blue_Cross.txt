Dear Dr. [mail merge provider’s last name],

We are sending you this letter to notify you that your Tax Identification Number (“TIN”), along
with your name and business address, were erroneously displayed on a PDF document posted to the
Anthem website, www.anthem.com/ca. The PDF documents were posted to Anthem.com for just
over 24 hours, from October 23, 2013 until October 24, 2013, and were intended to assist individuals
looking for information about physicians in certain provider networks. It appears that you use your
Social Security Number (SSN) as your TIN and thus it was included on this posting. Once
Anthem identified the error, we took immediate steps to remove the PDFs from the Anthem.com/ca
website. The PDFs were corrected and re-posted without the TINs.

Although we have no reason to believe your SSN was compromised, we are offering you free
identity protection services for one year under AllClear ID. AllClear ID offers Credit
Monitoring that delivers secure, actionable Credit Alerts to you by phone. AllClear ID Protection
also includes $1,000,000 Identity Theft Insurance Coverage and AllClear ID Fraud Resolution
