   RE: Important Security and Protection Notification
   Please read this entire letter.

Dear Sample A Sample:
We are contacting you about a data security incident that occurred at BulkReefSupply.com ("BRS"). While the
investigation is ongoing, it has been determined that the security of some data for some customers who logged
into the website from July 30, 2014 until January 30, 2015 may have been compromised. The outside cyber
hacker intrusion was initially discovered on January 21, 2015 and the data compromise was contained and
corrected on January 22, 2015. Further corrective action occurred on January 30th. This incident involved some
customers name, address, telephone number, email address/user name, password and credit card information.
The information DID NOT include SSN, personal health information or Fed ID. As a result, some customer's
personal information may have been potentially exposed to others. Please be assured that we have taken every
step necessary to address the incident, and that we are committed to fully protecting all of the information that
you have entrusted to us.
As soon as BRS discovered this potential issue, a forensic expert company was retained and the intrusion was
isolated and stopped. Forensic analysis was performed and it was confirmed that the problem was corrected.
Besides immediately securing the site and information in question, BRS added additional protections to the
locations of the personal information and put monitoring measures in place to insure this attack has been stopped
and will not occur in the future. BRS is confident that the risk of any potential future or ongoing breach has been
mitigated. BRS has also notified law enforcement and provided it with all the information about this intrusion.
What we are doing to protect your information:                                                                         0123456

     ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO HELP REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT
Þ   PLACE A 90-DAY FRAUD ALERT ON YOUR CREDIT FILE
An initial 90-day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a
victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the
credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps
to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be
satisfied. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.
             Equifax                           Experian                           TransUnion

         1-800-525-6285                    1-888-397-3742                      1-800-680-7289
        www.equifax.com                   www.experian.com                   www.transunion.com
Þ   PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT FILE
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for
you. Placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report
entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. With a security freeze in place, you will be required to
take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. This process is also completed through each
of the credit reporting companies.
Þ   ORDER YOUR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORTS
Visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228.
Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open
or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or
notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.
Þ   MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Take steps such as: carrying only essential documents with you; being aware of whom you are sharing your
personal information with and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.
Þ   USE TOOLS FROM CREDIT PROVIDERS
Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card and other account statements. Be proactive and
create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or
suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local
police and contact a credit reporting company.
