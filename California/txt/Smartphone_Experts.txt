Dear Sample A Sample:
Smartphone Experts recognizes the importance of the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information
provided to us by our customers and has always been committed to protecting this information. Regrettably,
we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.
On July 12, 2013, we learned that a hacker gained access into the computer system we use to process
payments for purchases made on our website. We immediately implemented measures to prevent any further
unauthorized access and engaged a leading data security firm to complete an investigation.
Although credit card information is encrypted when it is stored in our system, the investigation revealed that
the hacker may have had the technical ability to use a decryption feature of the system to view the name,
address, credit or debit card account number, CVV code, and the cards expiration date associated with orders
in our system. We are working with credit card companies to protect the cardholders that may have been
affected.
Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of the incident so you can take steps to protect your
card from any attempted misuse. We recommend that you remain vigilant to the possibility of unauthorized
charges on your card by reviewing your account statements. You should immediately report any unauthorized
charges on your card to your financial institution because the major credit card companies have rules that
typically guarantee cardholders will not be responsible for fraudulent charges.
While information that is typically used in identify theft, such as social security number, was not
compromised in this incident, always remain vigilant about protecting your identity by monitoring your credit
reports. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the
three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report please visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide
credit reporting companies is as follows:

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has
been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the attorney generals
office in your home state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take
to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact
your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you
are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade
Commission is as follows:
