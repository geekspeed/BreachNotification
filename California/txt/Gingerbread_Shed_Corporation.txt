Dear Sample A Sample:
         We are writing to notify you that as a result of an incident by an unauthorized third party, your personal
information may have been compromised. Specifically, we have learned that an unauthorized third party may have
obtained access to the personal information of our customers, which may have included names, addresses, telephone
numbers, e-mail addresses, credit card information, and the user names and passwords for our websites accounts. The
incident was limited to the time period between late November 2013 to mid-February 2014, and discovered in
approximately April 2014.
         We take this matter very seriously and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Upon learning of the incident,
we immediately began a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the criminal conduct. Further, we notified law
enforcement officials and intend to work closely with them in the investigation. In addition, we have deployed
additional security procedures to prevent future attacks.
          We have established a confidential assistance line so you can contact us should you have any questions
regarding the incident or the contents of this letter. This confidential assistance line is staffed with professionals familiar
with this incident and is operational Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. EST. The contact information is,
toll-free, (866) 597-8199. The reference number for this matter is 5474042814.
          There are certain steps you can take to protect against potential fraudulent activity. You are entitled to obtain a
copy of your credit report, free of charge. A credit report contains information about your credit history and the status of
your credit accounts. Your credit report could alert you to fraudulent activity being carried on in your name by an
identity thief. Please remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing all of your account statements
and monitoring your free credit reports by contacting any one of the national consumer reporting agencies set forth
below.
          The agencies can also provide you with information on how to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your
account. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit
report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may
delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages,
employment, housing or other services. If you have been the victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit
reporting agency with a valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. In all other            0123456

cases, a credit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a
security freeze. In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: Full name,
social security number, date of birth, addresses of residence for the past five years, proof of current address, legible
photocopy of a government-issued identification card, copy of police report or other law enforcement complaint or
report (if the victim of identity theft), and payment by check, money order, or credit card (if not a victim of identity
theft).
