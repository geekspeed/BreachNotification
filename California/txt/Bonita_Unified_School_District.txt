Dear Sample A Sample:
As you are aware, there was unauthorized access into the student information system at San Dimas High
School. I want to let you know that access to the system has been secured and no further unauthorized
changes have been made to the system. Grades have been restored to their state before the incident.
The unauthorized access may have involved some of your personal information as a student at San Dimas
High School. We at the Bonita Unified School District take this issue seriously and regret the concern it may
cause. Im writing to provide you information on the steps we are taking to protect you and your information
moving forward.
What happened?
On June 2, 2015, we discovered that unauthorized individuals gained access to our student database in May
2015 and changed the grades of several students at San Dimas High School. We believe the suspects also
accessed and downloaded personal information relating to students, including your name, Social Security
number, birthdate, medical information, Aeries username and password, and contact information, such as
physical address, email address and phone number. Upon learning this, we immediately reported the
incident to law enforcement and conducted an investigation to determine what information may have been
changed. We are cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation of this incident. The information that
was changed has been restored to its original status.
What is Bonita Unified School District doing to protect you?
While we have received no reports that your information has been used in any manner that would
compromise your identity or credit, out of an abundance of caution, we want to let you know that this
happened and assure you that we take it very seriously. Further, as a precaution, we are providing you with      0123456
a complimentary one-year membership in ProtectMyID® Alert from Experian. This product helps detect
possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection services
focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is completely free to

prevention and ProtectMyID Alert, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year

                                                                (OVER PLEASE)                                   B1194-L01
What is Bonita Unified School District doing to prevent this from happening in the future?
To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we are reviewing and increasing
information security measures within the district.
Where can you get more information on this issue?
If you have any questions, please call Donna Martin at 909-971-8320 ext. 5201, Monday through Friday
from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM Pacific Time.

District, as is helping you through this situation with the information and support you need.

Dr. Gary J. Rapkin
Superintendent

* Identity theft insurance is underwritten by insurance company subsidiaries or affiliates of American International Group, Inc. (AIG).
The description herein is a summary and intended for informational purposes only and does not include all terms, conditions and
exclusions of the policies described. Please refer to the actual policies for terms, conditions, and exclusions of coverage. Coverage
may not be available in all jurisdictions.




                                                                                                                                          B1194-L01
If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has
been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Office of the
Attorney General in your home state. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:
Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/idtheft,
1-877-438-4338
You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as
well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law
enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to
provide copies to creditors to correct your records.
Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your
creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that
an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim
of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an
extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the
appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can
place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at
the toll-free numbers listed below:
Equifax                            Experian                           TransUnion
877-478-7625                       888-397-3742                       800-680-7289
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your
credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued
to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from
accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other
third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze.
Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to
place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing,
temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each
credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at
each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to
state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more
information.
