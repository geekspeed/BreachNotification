Important Security and Protection Notification.
Please read this entire letter.

Dear John Q Sample,

We hope this letter finds you well. We are writing to inform you that on May 19, 2014,
our office was broken into and many items were stolen including three desktop
computers. Upon discovery the following day, the Sausalito Police Department was
immediately notified and a formal police report was filed.

We are notifying you of this incident because although all medical records were
encrypted and inaccessible, we believe one Excel spreadsheet containing approximately
2,780 patient names, including yours, and years of service may have been available.
Specifically, that document only contained a patientâ€™s first and last name, and the years
the patient was seen in our practice (for example, 2008 - 2010). Significantly and
fortunately, no social security numbers, dates of birth, financial information, contact
information nor medical conditions were listed.

Please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident and
have changed the security on that document. Though there does not appear to be any
risk for identity theft, you can call the three major credit agencies and place a 90-day
fraud alert. If so desired, their contact information is: Equifax (800-525-6285), Experian
(888-397-3742), and TransUnion (800-680-7289). You are also entitled to a free credit
report every year from each of these agencies at www.annualcreditreport.com.

As an extension of our care, we are also providing you with AllClear ID, which requires no
action on your part to be protected. If a problem arises, simply call 1-877-579-2269 using         *0101001084*
the reference code 9999999999 and a dedicated AllClear ID investigator will assist you
with any credit or financial concerns, and ensure your identity is returned to its proper
condition. AllClear ID maintains an A+ rating at the Better Business Bureau.

Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. We understand how important
                                                                                             0101001084




confidentiality and trust is to our physician-patient relationship. Please feel free to
contact 1-877-579-2269 to discuss any concerns or questions you may have.

Sincerely,


Bay Area Pain Medical Associates
