ABM PARKING SERVICES INC. PROVIDES PUBLIC NOTICE OF VENDOR’S DATA

CHICAGO, IL – December 5, 2014 – ABM Parking Services, Inc. (“the company”), today
announced that Datapark USA Inc. a vendor that provides and maintains point of service
software for several Chicago, Illinois parking facilities managed by the company, has confirmed
a data security incident. This incident may involve certain customer credit and debit card
information, including payment card numbers.

After being notified by Datapark of a potential compromise, the company launched an

transactions on the dates noted at these locations to review their payment card statements for
signs of unusual activity. Datapark has indicated that it has “blocked access to prevent any
further unauthorized entry into the[ir] servers.” The forensic evidence indicates that the
compromise was limited to payment card data and that no other personally identifiable
information was exposed. Law enforcement and the credit card brands have been notified of this
incident.

At no charge, customers can also have these credit bureaus place a "fraud alert" on their files that
alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify their identity prior to granting credit in their
names. Please note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect
the individual’s credit, a fraud alert may also delay the ability to obtain credit while the agency
verifies the individual’s identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms an individual’s fraud
alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on that individual’s file. Any individual wishing
to place a fraud alert, or who has questions regarding their credit report, can contact any one of
the following agencies: Equifax, P.O. Box 105069, Atlanta, GA 30348-5069, 800-525-6285,
www.equifax.com; Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, 888-397-3742,
www.experian.com; or TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, 800-680-7289,
www.transunion.com. Information regarding security freezes may also be obtained from these
sources.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also encourages those who discover that their information
has been misused to file a complaint with them. To file a complaint with the FTC, or to obtain
additional information on identity theft and the steps that can be taken to avoid identity theft, the
FTC can be reached at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20580, or at
www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/ or (877) ID-THEFT (877-438-4338); TTY: (866) 653-
4261. State Attorneys General may also have advice on preventing identity theft, and instances
of known or suspected identity theft should be reported to law enforcement, the Attorney
General in the individual’s state of residence, and the FTC. Individuals can also learn more about
placing a fraud alert or security freeze on their credit files by contacting the FTC or their state's
Attorney General. For North Carolina residents, the Attorney General can be contacted at 9001

Massachusetts Notice-


ABM PARKING SERVICES INC. PROVIDES PUBLIC NOTICE OF VENDOR’S DATA
SECURITY INCIDENT AT NINE CHICAGO PARKING LOTS

ABM Parking Services, Inc. (“the company”) announced that Datapark USA Inc., a vendor
which provides and maintains point of service software for several Chicago, Illinois parking
facilities operated by the company, has confirmed a data security incident that affects personal
information of certain parking lot customers. The company is issuing this public notice and
encouraging individuals who used payment cards (i.e., credit or debit cards) for transactions from
late September 2014 through mid-November 2014 at Chicago parking facilities to review their
payment card statements for signs of unusual activity and to take steps to protect their identities
and financial information. A toll-free, confidential information line is available to customers at
(877) 238-3790.

Under Massachusetts law, you have the right to obtain any police report filed in regard to this
incident. If you are the victim of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and
obtain a copy of it.

Massachusetts law gives you the right to place a security freeze on your consumer reports. A
security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your
name without your consent. Using a security freeze, however, may delay your ability to obtain
credit. You may request that a freeze be placed on your credit report by sending a request to a
credit reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular stamped mail to the address
below:

Equifax, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
Experian, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022, www.transunion.com

Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit
reporting company. The following information should be included when requesting a security
freeze (documentation for you and your spouse must be submitted when freezing a spouse’s
credit report): full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; Social Security number; date of
birth (month, day and year); current address and previous addresses for the past five (5) years;
and applicable fee (if any) or incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the
Department of Motor Vehicles. The request should also include a copy of a government-issued
identification card, such as a driver’s license, state, or military ID card, and a copy of a utility
bill, bank, or insurance statement. Each copy should be legible, display your name and current
mailing address, and reference the date of issue (statement dates must be recent). The credit
reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security
freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you
within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN)
or password, or both, that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security
freeze. The credit reporting company may charge a reasonable fee of up to $5 to place a freeze or
lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of
identity theft, and have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft to the credit
reporting company.

4829-3903-7984.1
To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit
report, you must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and
include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or
password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those
entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time
you want the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days
after receiving your request to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the
specified period of time. To remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each
of the three credit bureaus by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and social
security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security
freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove the
security freeze.
