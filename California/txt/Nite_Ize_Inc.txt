Dear Name Name Name:

Our consumer-facing website, www.niteize.com, is hosted and managed by a third-party website
services provider. We recently learned from our service provider that our online store was
subject to an attack in early March, and as a result, approximately 309 credit card numbers and
certain other customer information may have been accessed by unauthorized parties. We
immediately worked with our website provider to block the attack, repair the system, and
investigate the incident and damage it caused. We have reason to believe that your credit card
information was among those compromised and have contacted our bank and the credit card
companies so they can be alerted to any potential fraud or other unauthorized activity.

The other customer data involved may include information that you shared with us when creating
a website profile or ordering products, such as your name, Nite Ize user name, Nite Ize password,
mailing address, email address, credit card number, and/or telephone number(s).

The next time you visit www.niteize.com, you will be required to reset your password. If
you may have used the same password on other websites or services, we encourage you to
change those as soon as possible to protect your other online accounts.

We take seriously our responsibility to protect the personal information you provide to us and
apologize for this unfortunate event. We have been actively investigating the incident with our
website service provider and immediately took steps to protect our website against further
unauthorized access.

We recommend that you guard against identity theft by vigilantly monitoring account statements
and free credit reports available through the major credit bureaus listed below. We also urge you
to report any suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to your state
Attorney General’s office.

You can learn more about how to protect yourself against identity theft by contacting the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) toll-free at (877) ID-THEFT (43-84338), by mail at 600 Pennsylvania
Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20580, or through their website at
https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov. You can also contact your state Attorney General’s
office, or one of the three major credit bureaus listed here:

At your request, the credit bureaus can place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert lets
creditors know to contact you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing
accounts. If you contact one credit bureau, it is required to notify the other two, which will also
place an alert on their versions of your credit report.

For MASSACHUSETTS residents: Under Massachusetts law, you have the right to obtain any
police report filed regarding this incident. You may also choose to place a security freeze on
your credit report. Note that while a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from
releasing any information from your credit report without your authorization, it may delay or
otherwise interfere with any requests you make for loans or other services. Information
regarding how you place a security freeze is at the end of this letter.

For NORTH CAROLINA residents: You can also contact the North Carolina Attorney
General’s Office for more information about preventing identity theft at:

          North Carolina Attorney General’s Office
          9001 Mail Service Center
          Raleigh, NC 27699-9001
          Telephone: (919) 716-6400
          Fax: (919) 716-6750

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must make a written request to each of
the three major bureaus. You may contact the bureaus using the information here:

If you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit reporting bureau with a
valid police report, it cannot charge you to put in place, lift, or remove a security freeze.
Otherwise, a credit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to put in place,
temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide some or all of the following
information:
    1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
    2. Social Security number;
    3. Date of birth;
    4. Addresses where you have lived over the prior five (5) years;
    5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
    6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver’s license or
       ID card, military identification, etc.)
    7. If you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either the police report, investigative report,
       or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft;

If you are not a victim of identity theft, you will need to include payment by check, money order,
or credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through
the mail.

The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a
security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to
you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number
(PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the
security freeze.
