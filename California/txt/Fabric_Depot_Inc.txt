Dear Sample A Sample:
         On January 7, 2013, I learned of a data security incident that may have resulted in the disclosure of the
credit card information, names, and billing address associated with your online purchase. Shortly after learning of
the incident, we retained a forensic computer investigator, who determined that on or about October 16, 2012, an
unauthorized third party gained access to our website and data system. We are taking additional steps to enhance
the security of our systems. Such steps include changing our entire online payment process to have all credit card
information submitted through our website collected and handled by trusted third party payment processors.
Additionally, we have notified law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
         Unfortunately, the unauthorized third party may have obtained the first and last names, credit card and
debit card numbers, credit card verification codes, and billing addresses associated with your account. Fabric
Depot does not collect your social security number or date of birth.
         We are notifying you so that you can be aware of this situation and take steps to protect your information
from any harm, including contacting your bank and/or credit card company. It is important to carefully review
your account statement over the next 12 to 24 months, and promptly report any suspicious transactions to your
credit card company. Please review the attachment to this letter for information on additional steps you can take
to protect your information.
         As a valued customer, we would like to offer you (a) 30% off your next online order, (b) a free gift
(a fat quarter bundle) to be included with the order shipment, and (c) a USD $10.00 gift card to be included
with the order shipment. To redeem this offer, type the promotion code FGJN331 on the checkout page when
you place an order on www.fabricdepot.com. This offer will expire on April 30, 2013 and can only be used with
one order.

         We value your business and take the privacy of your information very seriously. We sincerely apologize
for any inconvenience this may cause you.

                                                                           Trudy Parry, President

                                                                                                             90198-LV1
                           STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We recommend that you cancel any credit cards or debit cards that may have been compromised, and that you
remain vigilant for incidents of fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your credit reports. You
may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free
1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to:
Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy
of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.
      Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
      Experian, P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
      TransUnion, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790, 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com
When you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. Look for accounts or creditor inquiries that you did not
initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home address and Social Security number, that is not
accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the
report. Promptly report any suspicious activity to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local
law enforcement, your states attorney general and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
You may contact the FTC or your states regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding identity
theft.
      Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center
      600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft.
      For residents of Maryland: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from
      the Maryland Office of the Attorney General:
           Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division
           200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023, www.oag.state.md.us
      For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft
      from North Carolina Attorney Generals Office:
           North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Consumer Protection Division
           9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov
Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors
on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud
alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An
initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your
credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended
fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling
the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.
           Equifax: 1-800-525-6285, www.equifax.com
           Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
           TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, www.transunion.com
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file,
so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get
access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws
vary from state to state.  The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state,
generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.  Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a
credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit
freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find
out more information:
