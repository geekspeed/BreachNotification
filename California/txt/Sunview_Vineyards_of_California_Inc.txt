                                     NOTIFICATION OF SECURITY BREACH

Dear ______________:

We are writing to inform you that on or about the 15th of December 2012, we believe that a company laptop computer
was stolen from one of our facilities as part of a burglary. We have reason to believe that personal information
concerning you was or may have been on the laptop computer and that information may be in the possession of the
thief. While the laptop computer was password protected, the files were not encrypted, so it is unclear if the thief has
or can access any of your personal information. Regardless, we wanted to make sure that you were aware of this issue.

The personal information related to you was located on an Excel spreadsheet related to workers’ compensation
management, which we believe was saved to the hard drive of the laptop computer. It is our understanding that the
spreadsheet included your name, social security number, nature/condition of your current or past workers’
compensation claim or injury, and your contact telephone number.

Please know that we have reported the theft of the laptop to the Kern County Sherriff’s Office and are hopeful that the
laptop and all information thereon will be retrieved. As of this date, we have received no indication that any
information has been used to your harm, but we want you to be fully aware of the situation.

If you have any concerns regarding identity theft relative to this security breach, you should consider taking the
following steps to protect yourself from potential harm:
    •   Register a fraud alert with the three credit bureaus listed here; and order credit reports:
             1. Experian: (888) 397-3742; www.experian.com; PO Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013
             2. TransUnion: (800) 680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud Victim Assistance Division, PO Box

          3. Equifax: (800) 525-6285; www.equifax.com; PO 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241
    •   Monitor account statements, EOBs, and credit bureau reports closely.
    •   Contact the California Office of Privacy Protection; http://www.privacy.ca.gov; 1-866-785-9663.
