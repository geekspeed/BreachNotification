Dear Client,

We have recently discovered unauthorized access to our computer network by unknown person or
persons. While the only losses so far are to Doug Thorburn personally (and we believe Doug Thorburn
was the target), it is possible personal information about you and your dependents including your name,
address, social security number, birthdate, driver’s license number and bank account information (for
those who use direct deposit for tax refunds) was obtained.

The breech occurred on or about July 12-15, 2013. We do not know how the breech occurred. This
notification was delayed because law enforcement personnel asked that we delay notification due to
the ongoing investigation.

We are disclosing this possible breach even though we do not believe it is reasonable to assume that
any unauthorized people actually accessed your information. Regardless, we are following up with law
enforcement detectives and doing everything to ensure this never happens again.

We suggest you monitor your credit information. You can access your credit information from the three
main credit reporting agencies either online at: https://www. annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp or by
contacting each agency at the phone number, website or address below:
