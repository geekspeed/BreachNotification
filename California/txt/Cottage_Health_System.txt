Dear (Narnc of Patient o,~ I,ega] Izepreei~tatrvc

We are writing to let you know of a recent security incident that may have resulted in the disclosure of your name, address,
date of birth, medical record number,account number,and health information including diagnosis, lab results, and procedures
performed at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital or Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. No social security numbers, driver's
license numbers, health insurance numbers, bank account numbers or any other financial information were exposed. At this
time, we are not aware of any misuse of your personal information. We take the security of your information very seriously,
and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

On December 2, 2013, Cottage Health System received a voicemail message informing us that a file containing personal
health information ofcertain patients may be available on Google. We immediately investigated this situation, and discovered
that a third party vendor for Cottage Health System and its affiliated hospitals, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital and Santa
Barbara Cottage Hospital("CHS") appeared to have, without CHS's knowledge, removed electronic security protections
from one of the servers, resulting in the exposure of certain information stored on the server.

We immediately removed the server from service, meaning no one can access the information on the server. We also
conducted a review of all computer servers to ensure that reasonable security measures are in place for our remaining
servers, and requested Google remove the file from its systems. Although we have no evidence to suggest anyone has used
the information contained on this server in any way, we want you to be aware of the situation and understand what you can
do to protect yourselffrom potential harm. We want to also assure you we have taken steps to prevent this type ofevent from
happening again including reviewing service relationships with third party vendors, expanding and increasing the frequency
of internal and external security checks and enhancing our "change notification system".
We take the security and privacy of information in our control very seriously. Although it is unlikely that your information
has been or will be misused, in an abundance of caution, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID
Experts to provide you with FraudStopTM PHI Edition. These services include:

                                  Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

Note: Minors, under the age of 18,should not have a credit history established and are under the age to secure credit.
Please also note that no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you, please follow the
instructions below to place the alert.
1. Telephone and enroll. Contact ID Experts at ]-877-264-9632 to gain additional information about this event, enroll in
the services being offered and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your
credit identity.
2. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring
credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of
the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call
1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus
every four months.
If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with ID Experts, notify them immediately by calling or by visiting
their Member website and filing a theft report.
If you file a theft report with ID Experts, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who will help
you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence
of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Experts Recovery Advocate who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and
reverse the damage quickly.
You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that
in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide
some kind of proof that you. have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report
suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

3. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus
by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including
contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert
can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as
follows:

 Credit Bureaus

 Equifax Fraud Reporting                    Experian Fraud Reporting                   TransUnion Fraud Reporting
 1-800-525-6285                             1-888-397-3742                             1-800-680-7289
 P.O. Box 740241                            P.O. Box 9554                              Fraud Victim Assistance Division
 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                     Allen, I'X 75013                           P.O. I3ox 6790
 www.alerts.ec~uifax.com                    www.exveriai~.com                          Fullerton, LA 92834-6790
                                                                                       www.tr~nsunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE ofthese bureaus and use only ONE ofthese methods. As soon as one ofthe three bureaus
confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters
in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.
4. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information
will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the
three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the
freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or
permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live in and for each credit reporting
agency. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement agency or
submitted an ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there may be no charge to place the freeze.
