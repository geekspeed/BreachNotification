Dear _______________:

Re: Card ending in [last 4 digits of the compromised card]

On May 16, 2013, Shumsky was notified by its e-commerce platform provider that on May 14,
2013, an unauthorized third party accessed the e-commerce platform and accessed nearly 1,400
of Shumsky cardholder records. We understand our service provider patched the vulnerability
the very next day, on May 15. We have engaged with proper security advisors and technical
experts to rectify the situation however, as a result of the incident, we are writing to you to make
you aware that your credit/debit card information might have been accessed by an unauthorized
party. This information included your name, address, email, credit/debit card number, expiration
date, and CVV code. Shumsky does NOT collect PINs for debit cards, SSNs, dates of birth or
driver’s license numbers thus this type of sensitive information was not involved.

Shumsky regrets this incident, has immediately engaged with technical and legal advisors to
work through the situation, and put in place updated measures to prevent this from happening
again. Shumsky is also working with the payment card brands concerning the specific payment
cards at issue in this incident. Nevertheless, we recommend that you monitor your payment card
account for potential unauthorized charges and alert your financial institution to monitor or
potentially cancel and reissue you a new card as they determine is prudent.

If you have further questions, please contact Shumsky at 1-800-414-8946 or 937-221-7103
between 8am and 5pm EST.

Additionally, we have enclosed information on steps you can take to further protect your
information. You may also access http://www.shumsky.com/cardinfo.html for more details.

Shumsky takes this matter very seriously and deeply regrets any inconvenience or concern that
this matter may cause you.

Sincerely,

Anita Emoff



President

       Fraud Alert

You may consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. This fraud alert statement informs creditors
of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to
establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the
three credit reporting agencies identified above.            Additional information is available at
http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

       Security Freeze

In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new
credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit

report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability
to obtain credit. Additionally, if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there
may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze; however, this fee may be less in
certain states (in MA, up to $5). In order to place a security free, you may be required to provide the
consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security
number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and
a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. You must separately place a security freeze on
your credit file with each credit reporting agency.
