    Dear John Q Sample:

    Imhoff and Associates, PC (“Imhoff”) is writing to inform you of an incident involving a theft of a backup hard
    drive that may have contained some of your information.

    What happened?

    During the early morning hours on June 27, 2014, a hard drive containing backup files for one of the firm’s servers
    was stolen from the locked trunk of an employee’s vehicle. The employee discovered the theft later that day and
    immediately notified the Santa Monica Police Department. We have been working with law enforcement but, to
    date, they have been unable to locate the stolen hard drive.

    Imhoff also immediately began an internal investigation to determine what information was contained on the hard
    drive. Working with outside computer forensic experts, we have confirmed that the hard drive may have contained
    your name, birthday, Social Security number, driver’s license number, and contact information, such as your home
    address, e-mail and phone number.

    What is Imhoff and Associates doing to protect me?

    Imhoff has no reason to believe that the hard drive was stolen for the information it contained or that your
    information has been accessed or used in any way. However, as a precaution, we have arranged to have AllClear ID
    help you protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services will be
    available to you beginning on the date of this notice, and you can use them at any time during the next 12 months.

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should
promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement
authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission
("FTC"). You may contact the FTC or your state's regulatory authority to obtain additional information about
avoiding and protection against identity theft: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center 600
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors
on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial
fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.
An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on
your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An
extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by
contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the toll-free numbers listed below:

Equifax                                       Experian                             TransUnion
877-478-7625                                  888-397-3742                         800-680-7289

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file,
so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get
access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your
ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze
laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by
state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately
place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish
a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below          *0202000000*
to find out more information.
