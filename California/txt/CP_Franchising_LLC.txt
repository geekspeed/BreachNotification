Dear <<First Name>><<Last Name>>:

CP Franchising is committed to providing excellent travel experiences, and we are committed to the privacy and
security of our clients. As part of this commitment, we are providing you this notice regarding potential unauthorized
access to your information. You may have previously received an email notification from us indicating that your
information may have been compromised. We are now sending this notification with more detailed information for
your consideration.

Brief Facts as to What Happened. CP Franchising received information on February 2, 2015, indicating that some
information may have been compromised, and we confirmed on February 4, 2015, a potential computer hacker
intrusion. Through the investigation that followed, CP Franchising has determined that an unauthorized person
gained access to its servers on or about January 30, 2015, and by inserting and running a malicious piece of computer
code, may have obtained information stored by CP Franchising in an encrypted fashion.

Nature of the Data Accessed. We are continuing our investigation regarding the extent of information that may
have been obtained. We have confirmed that information potentially at risk included various pieces of information
maintained by CP Franchising on behalf of your travel agent, possibly including your name, address, phone number,
credit card number, email address, passport number, loyalty program number, and date of birth.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Yourself from Harm. Although we do not have any evidence that your information
was accessed or misused as a result of this computer security incident, your information may be at risk. To help
protect you, we have engaged Experian, the largest credit bureau in the United States, to offer you complimentary
Fraud Resolution and identity protection for one year.

If you are a victim of fraud, simply call Experian at 866-578-5412 by February 11, 2016, and a dedicated Identity
Theft Resolution agent will help you restore your identity. Please provide your engagement number as proof of
