              Dear <<Firstname>> <<Middlename>> <<Lastname>>,
              On behalf of The Coca-Cola Company, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident discovered on
              December 10, 2013 that involved some of your personal information. We recently discovered the theft
              of several laptops assigned to current CCR and former CCE users that included personnel information.
              We began investigating the incident as soon as we learned of it, and are engaged with the appropriate
              law enforcement in this matter.
              We deeply regret this incident occurred and take very seriously the security of information on employees
              and other individuals. We have successfully recovered the laptops, and have determined that your
              <<ClientDef1(Breach Details Variable Text)>> were included.
              While we have no indication that your information was misused, we recommend that you review the
              information provided in this letter for some steps to help protect your personal information. As a precaution,
              we have arranged for you, at your option, to enroll in a 12 month credit monitoring service, which will be
              paid for by The Coca-Cola Company. We have engaged Kroll to provide you with its Identity Theft Protection

              regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. If you discover
              any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it

You may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security
freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can
make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to
protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just
one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert,
it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact
the nationwide credit reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on your credit report
to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written
authorization.
If you have any questions or concerns, please call 1-855-???-CCus.
