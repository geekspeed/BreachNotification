       Dear John Sample,

       SterlingBackcheck provides background screening services to clients throughout the world, including to a
       client with which you recently applied for employment. As part of your application process, we received
       personal information relating to you, including your name, Social Security number, and date of birth. We
       recently discovered an incident that may affect the security of this personal information. While we are
       unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information, we are writing to provide you with
       information regarding the incident, steps we‚Äôve taken since discovering the incident, and information on
       what you can do to better protect against identity theft and fraud should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

       What Happened? On May 29, 2015, a password-protected laptop was stolen from a SterlingBackcheck
       employee‚Äôs vehicle. The employee reported the theft to our office, and we launched an investigation to
       determine what information may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. While our
       investigation is ongoing, we‚Äôve determined a file containing your name, Social Security number, and date
       of birth may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. We are unaware of any actual or
       attempted misuse of this information, and there is no indication the data that may have been stored
       on the laptop was the target of the theft.

       What is SterlingBackcheck Doing? We take the security of your personal information seriously. In
       addition to launching the ongoing investigation into this incident, we have implemented additional
       measures to mitigate against the risk that an incident like this will happen again by updating our
       encryption and audit procedures, revising our equipment custody protocols, retraining employees on
       privacy and data security, and installing remote-wipe software on portable devices.

       In addition to the steps above, we‚Äôve provided notice of this incident to our potentially impacted clients
       and are coordinating with these clients to disclose this incident to its potentially impacted candidates and
       provide potentially impacted candidates with complimentary access to 24 months of free credit
       monitoring and identity restoration services with AllClear ID. The enclosed Privacy Safeguards
       Information contains instructions on how to enroll and receive these complimentary services, as well as
       additional information that can be used to better protect against identity theft and fraud. We are also
       providing notice of this incident to certain state regulators and consumer reporting agencies, as required.

       What Can You Do? You can review the enclosed Privacy Safeguards Information. You can also enroll
       to receive the complimentary access to 24 free months of credit monitoring and identity restoration
       services. You can also contact the confidential inquiry line we‚Äôve established relating to this incident.
       This confidential inquiry line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable

                             PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS INFORMATION

To help detect the possible misuse of your information, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect
your identity for 24 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the date
of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 24 months.

Please note: Additional steps may be required by you in order to activate your phone alerts.

You may also take action directly to further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss.
We encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account
statements regularly and monitoring your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S law you are
entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order
your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may
also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a ‚Äúfraud alert‚Äù on your file that alerts creditors
to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that
because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to
obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud
alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or
should you have any question regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed
below:

            Equifax                             Experian                          TransUnion

You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau
from releasing any information from a consumer‚Äôs credit report without the consumer‚Äôs written
authorization. However, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay,
interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages,
employment, housing, or other services.

If you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it
cannot charge you to place, list or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge
you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. You will need to place a
security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a
freeze on all of your credit files.
