Dear <<Patient Name>>,
This letter is to notify you of theft of personal information that may affect you. On May 15, 2015, Montefiore
was informed by law enforcement that an employee stole patient account information from Montefiore’s electronic
medical record system. The theft occurred between January 2013 and June 2013 and information stolen included
names, addresses, Social Security numbers, next of kin, and health insurance information. There is no evidence that
medical information, such as test results or diagnosis, was obtained. The employee was arrested, fired, and is being
prosecuted for this crime.
When the theft was discovered, Montefiore began an internal investigation and immediately implemented additional
safeguards to strengthen the security of our systems. Montefiore is fully cooperating with the police and the Manhattan
District Attorney’s office to support their criminal prosecution.
Law enforcement informed us that the employee may have sold the patient information that was stolen from
Montefiore, and that you may be the victim of identity theft. Montefiore is providing identity theft protection
services at no cost to you through ID Experts®, an expert data breach and recovery services firm, to all individuals

                              Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to www.myidcare.com/recoveryprotect and follow the instructions for enrollment
using your Access Code provided above. Once you have completed your enrollment, you will receive a welcome
letter by email (or by mail if you do not provide an email address when you sign up). The welcome letter will direct
you to the exclusive ID Experts’ Member Website where you will find other valuable educational information.
2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your membership with ID Experts, which is paid for by
Montefiore. Credit monitoring is included in the membership, but you must personally activate it for it to be effective.
Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need
assistance, ID Experts will be able to assist you.
3. Telephone. Contact ID Experts at 1-888-266-9438 to gain additional information about this event and speak with
knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.
4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and
monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit
report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.
annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free
report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.
If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with ID Experts, notify them immediately by calling or by
visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.
If you file a theft report with ID Experts, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who will
help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a
consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Experts Recovery Advocate who will work on your behalf
to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly.
You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note
that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to
provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items.
You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.
5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this
after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone
and also via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including
contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud
alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three
bureaus is as follows:

Equifax Fraud Reporting                 Experian Fraud Reporting                 TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-525-6285                          1-888-397-3742                           1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 740241                         P.O. Box 9554                            P.O. Box 2000
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                  Allen, TX 75013                          Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.alerts.equifax.com                  www.experian.com                         www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three
bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive
confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.
6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying
information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will
need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind
that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card
until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live
in and for each credit reporting bureau. The Credit Bureau may charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze, lift, or
remove a freeze. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your local law enforcement
agency or submitted an ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there may be no charge to
place the freeze.
