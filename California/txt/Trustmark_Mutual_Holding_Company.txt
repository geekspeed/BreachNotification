Dear Sample A Sample:
Trustmark is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of your personal information.
We are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of your personal information, but are providing this notice to
ensure that you are aware of the incident, and so that you may take steps to protect your information should you
feel it is appropriate to do so.
On May 13, 2015, our automated billing e-mail system generated and sent encrypted e-mails to certain insurance
carrier clients. While each encrypted email should have contained a single file with information related to each
carriers insureds, on May 14, 2015, we discovered that a software error resulted in each carrier receiving file
attachments for all of the carriers instead of just the one file related to their own insureds. Upon learning of the
error, we took steps to recall the emails. We contacted each insurance carrier recipient and requested
confirmation that the emails and the attachments had been permanently deleted. We have identified and corrected
the software error that caused this incident, and implemented safeguards to ensure it does not occur again.
Trustmark takes the security of your personal information very seriously. We performed a thorough investigation
in order to confirm the nature and scope of this incident. Trustmark is working with the insurance carrier
recipients that inadvertently received this information, and the carriers are cooperating with us to ensure that they
properly dispose of and permanently delete the e-mails. The recipients are sophisticated organizations with whom
we have a contractual partnership, and they also understand the necessity of protecting sensitive information. We
believe the risk of misuse of your information is low, but we are providing this notice to you in an abundance of
caution. The personal information included on the spreadsheets inadvertently shared with the other insurance
carrier clients included your name, social security number, and payroll deduction information.
To help protect your identity, we have engaged Experian®, the largest credit bureau in the United States, to offer
you complimentary Fraud Resolution and identity protection for two years.
If you are a victim of fraud, simply call Experian at 866-751-1324 by June 10, 2016 and a dedicated Identity
Theft Resolution agent will help you restore your identity. Please provide the engagement number in this letter as       0123456

proof of eligibility.

                                                               (OVER PLEASE)



                                                                                                                        B0932-L01

* Identity theft insurance is underwritten by insurance subsidiaries or affiliates of AIG. The description herein is a summary and intended for informational
purposes only and does not include all terms, conditions or exclusions of the policies described. Please refer to the actual policies for terms, conditions, and
exclusions of coverage. Coverage may not be available in all jurisdictions.                                                                                        B0932-L01
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your file that alerts creditors to take
additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the
agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to
place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding
your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.
