RE:     Notice of Data Security Incident
Dear Sample A Sample:
I am writing to inform you that Billy Casper Golf has been the targeted victim of an email spoofing attack, and
that the security of your personal information, contained on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Form W-2,
may be at risk as a result of this incident. While our investigation is ongoing and we do not have any evidence this
information has been misused, we feel it is important to notify you about this incident, encourage you to file your
tax return as soon as possible if you have not already done so, and provide you with the information below that
you can use to better protect against identity theft and fraud.
What Happened? On Friday, February 26, Billy Casper Golf was the targeted victim of an e-mail spoofing
attack.  Through this attack, a request was made for all 2015 employee W2 information.  Unfortunately, this
information was provided before it was discovered that the request was made from a fraudulent account by an
individual purporting to be our CEO.  We discovered the fraudulent nature of this request on Saturday, February
27, 2016 and have been working tirelessly to investigate. 
What Information Was Involved? Your IRS Tax Form W-2 was among the forms that were sent in response to
the request. An IRS Tax Form W-2 includes the following categories of information: (1) the employees name;
(2) the employees address; (3) the employees Social Security number; and (4) the employees wage information.
What We Are Doing? We take this incident, and the security of your personal information, very seriously. We
have stringent security measures in place to protect the security of information in our possession, and, as a result
of this incident, we are working to implement additional safeguards and provide additional mandatory training to
our employees on safeguarding the privacy and security of information on our systems.
In addition to notifying individuals impacted by this incident, we have notified the Fairfax County Police
Department. We will also be notifying Attorneys General in a number of different states, and the three (3)
national credit reporting agencies (i.e., Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Additionally, we are offering all            0123456

affected individuals access to two years of three bureau credit monitoring and identity restoration services with
Experian. The enclosed Privacy Safeguards Information contains instructions on how to enroll and receive these
free services, as well as more information on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud.




                                                                                                                       B7655-L01
What You Can Do? You can review the enclosed Privacy Safeguards Information. You can also enroll to
receive the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services.
For More Information. We want to be sure our employees receive immediate access to information about this
incident and access to tools that you can use to better protect against identity theft and fraud. If you have any
questions or would like additional information, please call 877-213-5100 Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7
p.m. EST and provide reference number 9416022816 when calling.
Billy Casper Golf takes the privacy of employees personal information seriously. We sincerely regret any
inconvenience or concern this incident has caused you.
Sincerely,

Alex Elmore
President
Billy Casper Golf

 Identity theft insurance is underwritten by insurance company subsidiaries or affiliates of AIG. The description herein is a summary and intended for
informational purposes only and does not include all terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies described. Please refer to the actual policies for terms,
conditions, and exclusions of coverage. Coverage may not be available in all jurisdictions.
                                                                                                                                                                  B7655-L01
Billy Casper Golf encourages you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and financial loss by reviewing
your account statements, and monitoring your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, everyone is
entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order a free credit report,
visit http://www.annualcreditreport.com/ or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. Individuals may also contact the three
major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of their credit report:
      Equifax                               Experian                           TransUnion
      P.O. Box 105069                       P.O. Box 2002                      P.O. Box 2000
      Atlanta, GA 30348                     Allen, TX 75013                    Chester, PA 19022
      800-525-6285                          888-397-3742                       800-680-7289

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert will tell
creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name; however, because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the credit
bureaus verify your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place
fraud alerts on your files. You may use the contact information listed above to contact the major credit bureaus and
place a fraud alert on your credit report.
You can also place a security freeze on your credit file that prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any
information from your credit report without your written authorization but may delay, interfere with, or prevent the
timely approval of any requests for new credit. If you have been a victim of identity theft, and provide the credit
reporting agency with a valid police report, the credit reporting agency cannot charge to place, lift or remove a
security freeze. In all other cases, a credit agency may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently
remove a security freeze. You must contact each of the credit reporting agencies separately to place a security freeze
on your credit file:

You can also contact the IRS at www.irs.gov/Individuals/Identity-Protection for helpful information and guidance on

protect yourself, by contacting your state Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade
