                                    Important B&N Customer Notice
October 24, 2012


Dear Barnes & Noble Customers,

        Barnes & Noble has just made an announcement regarding the security of personal data
provided for purchases made in some of our retail stores using credit and debit card PIN pad devices.
We want to make sure you are aware of the announcement, understand what happened, and know the
steps that you can take if you are concerned.

         We have detected a sophisticated criminal effort to steal credit and debit card information from
our customers who have swiped their cards through PIN pads when they made purchases at certain
retail stores. The tampered devices were capable of capturing information such as name, card account
number, and PIN.

        We discovered this tampering during maintenance and inspection of the devices, and we
promptly discontinued the use of all PIN pads in our nearly 700 retail stores nationwide. We also
informed federal law enforcement authorities, and we began a thorough internal review involving the
inspection of every PIN pad in every store. Customers can make transactions securely today by asking
Booksellers to swipe their cards through the card readers connected to cash registers.

        We want to reassure you that this situation does not involve any purchases you may have made
at Barnes & Noble.com or using your NOOK or a NOOK mobile app. The Barnes & Noble member
database is secure. The tampering only affected transactions in which customers swiped their cards at
one of the compromised in-store PIN pads.

         If you are concerned that your card information may have been compromised, you should take
the following steps:

    Debit Card Users:

        Change the PIN numbers on your debit cards
        Review your accounts for unauthorized transactions
        Notify your banks immediately if you discover any unauthorized purchases or withdrawals

    Credit Card Users:

        Review your statements for any unauthorized transactions
        Notify your card-issuing banks if you discover any unauthorized purchases or cash advances

        We recommend that you remain vigilant even if you do not find any suspicious activity at this
time and that you monitor your credit reports. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report
annually from each of the three national credit bureaus. A guide with further steps you can take to
protect your personal information is attached for your reference.
        Barnes & Noble is cooperating with federal law enforcement in this matter. In addition, the
company is working with banks, payment card brands and issuers to identify accounts that may have
been compromised, so banks and issuers can employ enhanced fraud security measures on potentially
impacted accounts. B&N is also implementing additional security measures designed to prevent a
recurrence of such PIN pad tampering and to protect the privacy of our customers. For example, we
have removed all PIN pads from our retail stores.

       We value your business and B&N takes its responsibility to protect your privacy very seriously. If
you have further questions about this matter, please feel free to call us at 1-888-471-7809

        For your reference, the following is a copy of the press release we issued today:

              BARNES & NOBLE DETECTS TAMPERING WITH PIN PAD DEVICES AT STORES


        October 24, 2012; New York – Barnes & Noble has detected tampering with PIN pad devices
used in 63 of its stores. Upon detecting evidence of tampering, which was limited to one compromised
PIN pad in each of the affected stores, Barnes & Noble discontinued use of all PIN pads in its nearly 700
stores nationwide. The company also notified federal law enforcement authorities, and has been
supporting a federal government investigation into the matter.
        Barnes & Noble has completed an internal investigation that involved the inspection and
validation of every PIN pad in every store. The tampering, which affected fewer than 1% of pin pads in
Barnes & Noble stores, was a sophisticated criminal effort to steal credit card information, debit card
information, and debit card PIN numbers from customers who swiped their cards through PIN pads
when they made purchases. This situation involved only purchases in which a customer swiped a credit
or debit card in a store using one of the compromised PIN pads.
        The company emphasized that its customer database is secure. Purchases on Barnes &
Noble.com, NOOK and NOOK mobile apps were not affected. The member database was also not
affected. None of the affected PIN pads was discovered at Barnes & Noble College Bookstores.
        Barnes & Noble is continuing to assist federal law enforcement authorities in this matter. In
addition, the company is working with banks, payment card brands and issuers to identify accounts that
may have been compromised, so banks and issuers can employ enhanced fraud security measures on
potentially impacted accounts.
        The criminals planted bugs in the tampered pin pad devices, allowing for the capture of credit
card and pin numbers. Barnes & Noble disconnected all pin pads from its stores nationwide by close of
business September 14, and customers can securely shop with credit cards through the company's cash
registers. Barnes & Noble said it is committed to providing customers with a safe shopping
environment.


        Tampered pin pads were discovered from stores in the following states: CA, CT, FL, NJ, NY, IL,
MA, PA, RI. A complete list of specific stores follows.

             Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information
       B&N is providing this reference guide to assist our customers who believe their account
information may have been compromised. We encourage customers to remain vigilant, review
payment card account statements, monitor credit reports, and consider these additional steps.

Review Your Account Statements

        As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your
account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account,
you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is
maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of
identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).

       To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-
438-4338). Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTC’s Identity Theft Data
Clearinghouse, which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies.

Credit Reports

        To order a free copy of your credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free
at (877) 322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the FTC website at
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/resources/forms/requestformfinal.pdf and mail it to

                               Annual Credit Report Request Service,
                                         P.O. Box 105281,
                                     Atlanta, GA 30348-5281

       The three national credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the
website, toll-free number, or request form.

        When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
Look in the "inquiries" section for names of creditors from whom you haven't requested credit.
Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The credit bureau
will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the "personal information" section for any
inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social Security number).

        If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on
the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should
notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon
as possible so the information can be internal review and, if found to be in error, corrected. If
there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit
bureau by telephone and in writing.
Consulting the FTC

       If you detect any incident of fraud, promptly report the incident to your local law
enforcement authority, your state Attorney General and the FTC. If you believe your account has
been compromised, the FTC recommends that you take these additional steps:

        Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened
        fraudulently. When you dispute new unauthorized accounts, use the FTC's ID Theft
        Affidavit, which is available at
        http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/resources/forms/affidavit.pdf.
        File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and
        any others that may require proof of the crime.

        You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself:

Police Report

         If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or account statements, or have reason to
believe that your personal information is being misused, contact your local law enforcement authorities
immediately and file a police report. You have the right to request a copy of the police report and should
retain it for further use, as creditors may request such documentation to waive your potential liabilities
in connection with fraudulent activity.

Fraud Alerts

         To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your
credit file. A fraud alert notifies you of an attempt by an unauthorized person to open a new
credit account in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for
credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert
notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a free
fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers provided
below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a
fraud alert at all three credit bureaus. You can also place a fraud alert on your credit report
online at the websites listed below.

Security Freeze

         Some state laws allow you to place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security
freeze would prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from your credit
report without your written permission. You should be aware, however, that placing a security
freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any
requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. The
specific costs and procedures for placing a security freeze vary by state, but this Reference Guide
provides general information. You can find additional information at the websites of any of the
three credit reporting agencies listed below.

        If you believe that you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the credit
reporting agency with a valid police report, the agency will not charge you to place, lift or remove a
security freeze on your credit reports. In all other cases, a credit reporting agency may charge
you a fee, which generally ranges from $5.00 to $20.00 per action.

        Requirements vary by state, but generally you may place a security freeze on your credit
report by sending a written request to each of the three credit reporting agencies noted below,
which may require the following information to verify your identity:
        (1) full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
        (2) social Security number;
        (3) date of birth;
        (4) addresses for the prior five years;
        (5) proof of current address; and
        (6) a legible copy of a government issued identification card.

       You also may provide a copy of any relevant police report, investigative report, or
complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning the incident.
