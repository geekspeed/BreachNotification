                              ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT YOURSELF

To further protect against possible fraud, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account
statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious or unauthorized activity.

Credit Report

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus.
To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may
also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

Fraud Alert

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert” on your file that alerts creditors to
take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it
tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the
agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to
place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions
regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below. Information regarding security
freezes is also available from these agencies.

Security Freeze

Some state laws allow you to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze prohibits a credit
reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer’s credit report without written authorization.
However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or
prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or
other services. If you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit reporting agency with a
valid police report, it cannot charge you to place, lift or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit
reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 (and in some cases, up to $20.00).

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major

                                                                                                                                      *0204000000*
consumer reporting agencies by regular, certified or overnight mail at the addresses below:

                                                                                                                                0204000000




                                                                                www.freeze.transunion.com

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information: (1) Your full name
(including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.); (2) Social Security Number; (3) Date of birth; (4) If you have
moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years; (5) Proof
of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill; (6) A legible photocopy of a government issued
identification card (state driver’s license or ID card, military identification, etc.); (7) If you are a victim of identity
theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency
concerning identity theft; (8) If you are not a victim of identity theft, include payment by check, money order, or
credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the mail.

The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze
on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business
days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or both that can be used
by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must
call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name,
address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the
security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit
report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have
three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for
the specified period of time.

To remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail and
include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password
provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business days after
receiving your request to remove the security freeze.

Federal and State Resources

You can also further educate yourself regarding identity theft, and the steps you can take to protect yourself,
including how to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file, by contacting the Federal Trade
Commission or your state Attorney General. For North Carolina residents, the Attorney General can be
contacted at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, (877) 566-7226 (toll-free in North Carolina),
(919) 716-6400, www.ncdoj.gov. For Maryland residents, the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division
can be contacted at 200 St. Paul Place, 16th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21202, (888) 743-0023 (toll-free in Maryland),
(410) 576-6300, www.oag.state.md.us.

The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to
file a complaint with them. The Federal Trade Commission can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC 20580, www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/, 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY:
1-866-653-4261.



Police Report

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or account statements, or have reason to believe that your
personal information is being misused, contact your local law enforcement authorities immediately and file a
police report. You have the right to request a copy of the police report and should retain it for further use, as
many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of potential fraudulent debts. Notice of this
event was not delayed because of law enforcement.
