Attention [Mail Merge]

We are writing to you because of an information security incident at Salinas Valley
State Prison (SVSP) involving your personal information.

On September 26, 2012 it was discovered that a database file containing personal
information for custody staff, which was located on the institutional server, was
accessible to all SVSP staff. The database file contained your first and last name,
Social Security number, personal phone number, address, and institutional-position
information.

All SVSP staff have been trained on handling sensitive and confidential information in
the course of their work; however, access to the database file should have been limited
to only those personnel with an authorized business need to work with this information.

To protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you place a
fraud alert on your credit accounts by following the recommended privacy protection
steps outlined in the enclosure.
The database file is now secure and has been relocated to a more restricted location on
the server to limit accessibly to a restricted security group.

For more information on identity theft, you may visit the Web site of the California Office
of Privacy Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov.

We regret that this incident occurred and want to assure you that we are reviewing and
revising our procedures and practices to minimize the risk of recurrence. Should you
need any further information about this incident, please contact the Warden's office, at
831-678-5906.
