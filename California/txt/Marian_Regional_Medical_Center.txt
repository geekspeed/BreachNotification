Dear <patient>,


At Marian Regional Medical Center (Santa Maria and Arroyo Grande Campuses), the security of
our patientsâ€™ medical information is of the utmost importance. We are committed to protecting
your privacy and complying with all privacy laws. This commitment includes notifying our
patients if we believe that the security of their medical records may have been compromised.

A secured electronic file containing your limited patient information was sent to a contracted
health insurance plan other than your own health insurance plan. Fortunately, the health
insurance plan agent verified the file was sent in error and notified us promptly. We
immediately stopped sending the files. The file information included your name, address, type
of insurance, date of birth, date of service, type of laboratory test and test results for dates of
service between March 1 and March 6, 2014. Your social security number was not included.
Again, the information was sent in an electronic format that was secure. Based on assurances
we have received from the health insurance plan, we believe that the information has not been
and will not be used for fraudulent purposes.

We apologize for any inconvenience and we are happy to address any questions or concerns you
may have. Please feel to contact us at our toll-free at 1-877-906-1603.


Sincerely,


Sandra Mugg
Acting Facility Privacy Official
