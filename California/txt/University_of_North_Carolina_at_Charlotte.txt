                   Important Notice about your Confidential Information – May 9, 2012

        On February 15, 2012, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (the “University”) announced that,
because of incorrect access settings, a large amount of electronic data hosted by the University were accessible
from the Internet. Subsequent investigation has determined that there were two access issues, one affecting
general University systems over a period of approximately three months, and another affecting the University’s
The William States Lee College of Engineering systems over a period exceeding a decade. The University has
no reason to believe that any information from either of these incidents was inappropriately accessed or that
information was used for identity theft or other crime. The exposed data included personal information, which
could include your name, address, social security number, or credit card information provided in association
with transactions with the University. We have involved state and federal regulatory and law enforcement
agencies to assist us in determining how to proceed.
        Although we have seen no evidence suggesting that the data have been used in any way, out of an
abundance of caution we have made the decision to notify you of the loss so that you can be alert to any possible
changes in use of your personal information or accounts. The University continues to monitor the situation
carefully and has increased its internal review procedures to watch for any unusual activity. Several public
protections are available to assist in avoiding identity theft. I encourage you to monitor your personal
information. If you notice suspicious activity, you should report it immediately to the University at the
following number 1-855-205-6937 and to any financial institution involved. You should also contact the
Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, at 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338), or at 600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, and you may call your local sheriff’s office and file a police report of
identity theft, keeping a copy of the police report. In addition, you may contact the Consumer Protection
Division of the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office at 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699, by
phone at 1-919-716-6000 or toll free in North Carolina at 1-877-566-7226. If you reside outside of North
Carolina, the contact information for the Attorney General of your state can be found on the website for the
National Association of Attorneys General available at http://www.naag.org/current-attorneys-general.php.
         If you wish to protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, you can place a free fraud alert on
your credit files. A fraud alert notifies creditors to contact you before opening new accounts in your name.
Contact any one of the three major credit reporting agencies at the numbers/addresses below to place a fraud
alert with all three agencies. You will then receive letters from all of these agencies, with instructions on how to
receive a free copy of your credit report from each agency.
        Experian                          Equifax                          TransUnion

        The University consistently utilizes industry standard information protections, uses leading data
management vendors, and has dramatically increased its information protection capacity since the discovery of
the exposures. Nonetheless, the University is currently reviewing all aspects of its information security. For
more information, you may go to the University’s webpage set up to address this matter at
securityincident.uncc.edu.   You may also call us toll-free at 1-855-205-6937, or e-mail us at
securityincident@uncc.edu.
       On behalf of the University, I apologize for any inconvenience this incident might have caused, and
promise that we are working hard to maintain protections for sensitive data.

        Thank you,
