          Re:        Data Breach Notification

          Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:

          The California Public Records Act (PRA) requires the Department of Business Oversight
          (DBO) to provide the public copies of the non-confidential portions of our electronic
          licensing records upon request. To process these requests, DBO utilizes the records
          contained in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) Central Registration
          Depository (CRD). Fields clearly designated as containing personal identifying information
          within the FINRA CRD are then redacted by DBO prior to its release. However, despite our
          efforts, DBO recently learned that, pursuant to one or more PRA requests, the personal
          identifying information of a number of registered investment advisers and broker-dealers
          was inadvertently disclosed to persons not authorized to receive such information.

          Our initial investigation revealed that your Social Security number was disclosed in a field
          entitled “Docket/Case #.” Since a docket or case number traditionally are not based on an
          individual’s Social Security number, we did not redact the contents of this field.

          To protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you to place a
          fraud alert on your credit files by following each of the privacy protection steps outlined in
          the enclosure provided with this letter.

          For more information about protecting yourself from identity theft, you may visit the
          website of the Privacy Enforcement and Protection Unit of the California Department of
          Justice at www.privacy.ca.gov.

          While we continue to investigate this matter, we have placed an immediate hold on
          providing the public with copies of our electronic licensing records until further notice. In
          addition, we are working with FINRA and our own staff to prevent any further inadvertent
          disclosures of personal identifying information.
