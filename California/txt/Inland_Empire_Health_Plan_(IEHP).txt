Dear <First><Last>,

IEHP has learned that a security breach at a local provider’s office affects some of your
IEHP Member information.

On October 28, 2014, a desktop computer and other items were reportedly stolen from
Children’s Eyewear Sight, located on 11940 Foothill Blvd., Ste. 107, Rancho
Cucamonga, CA, 91739. The local police were involved, and a suspect has been
apprehended. However, saved to the stolen computer was a file that contained data about
a number of people, including you.

The information in the file included your name, date of birth, gender, address and contact
phone number, an email address, IEHP Member ID number, date of appointment, date of
purchase and the name of the doctor who provided your optical prescription. Your social
security number was not in this file and is not at risk.

Children’s Eyewear Sight notified IEHP about the incident and are taking steps to secure
any past, present and future data related to our Members.

The Compliance Department at IEHP has taken appropriate steps to report this incident to
the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), the Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS), the California Office of Attorney General (OAG) and to local media.

While there is no indication that your information will be used for fraudulent activities,
IEHP would like to offer you the option of applying a confidentiality alert to the
electronic record maintained by IEHP. If you are interested, please contact IEHP’s
Member Services Department at 1-800-440-4347. TTY users can call 1-800-718-4347.

IEHP takes its duty to secure the personal information of our Members very seriously,
and we appreciate the trust you have placed in us by choosing us as your health plan. We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.


Sincerely,

IEHP Compliance Department
