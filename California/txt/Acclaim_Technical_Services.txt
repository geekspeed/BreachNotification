       Dear John Sample,

       We recently learned that Acclaim Technical Services, Inc., (“ATS”) was the target of a
       malicious, state-sponsored cyber intrusion which resulted in the theft of certain background
       investigation and other records containing personal information. You are receiving this letter
       because we have determined that your personal information may have been included in a
       background investigation form that was compromised during the incident.

       As soon as we discovered the incident, we took appropriate steps to contain it. We have retained
       experts in cybersecurity to assist us in our investigation of the incident and are cooperating fully
       with the FBI in its investigation. Based on our investigation to date, the intrusion appears to
       have taken place over several weeks beginning in late August, and is highly sophisticated in
       nature.

       We want you to know that we are working hard to help those impacted by this incident and to
       prevent this from happening again in the future. ATS will provide you and your dependent,
       minor children with comprehensive identity theft protection and monitoring services at no cost to
       you.

       If you submitted a background investigation form in connection with your employment at
       ATS, the information stolen may have included your name, Social Security number, address,
       date and place of birth, residency, educational and employment history, personal foreign travel
       history, information about immediate family as well as business and personal acquaintances, and
       other information used to conduct and adjudicate your background investigation.

       If your information was included in a background investigation form prepared by a
       spouse, or co-habitant, the information stolen may have included your name, Social Security
       number, address, date and place of birth, and citizenship information.




                                                                                        ,A.QAC^!^P

law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting

In addition, we have arranged to provide comprehensive identity protection and credit
monitoring services to you and your dependent, minor children for 36 months at no cost to you.

                                                Reference Guide

We encourage you to take the following steps:

Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call
toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission’s (“FTC”) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service,
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit
reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the
“inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit. Some companies bill under
names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you
when that is the case. Look in the “personal information” section for any inaccuracies in your information
(such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the
consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning
sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your
report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to
be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate
consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your
report with you. If the information can’t be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved.
Information that can’t be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff’s office because it
may signal criminal activity.

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your
payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly
report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC and your state Attorney General. If you believe your identity
has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps:

   ·   Place an initial fraud alert.
   ·   Order your credit reports.
   ·   Create an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit by submitting a report about the theft at
       http://www.ftc.gov/complaint or by calling the FTC.
   ·   File a police report about the identity theft and get a copy of the police report or the report number.
       Bring your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit with you when you file the police report.
   ·   Your Identity Theft Report is your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit plus your police report. You may be
       able to use your Identity Theft Report to remove fraudulent information from your credit report, prevent
       companies from refurnishing fraudulent information to a consumer reporting agency, stop a company
       from collecting a debt that resulted from identity theft, place an extended seven-year fraud alert with
       consumer reporting agencies, and obtain information from companies about accounts the identity thief
       opened or misused.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft
and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft,
consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an
identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of
someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft.
The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert
on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated
telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies.
For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security freeze” (also
known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from
accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for
placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a
fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually.
For more information on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or
the FTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state,
please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.

The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request.              For
example, you may be asked to provide:

   ·   Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)
   ·   Your Social Security number
   ·   Your date of birth
   ·   Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
   ·   A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s license or military ID
       card)
   ·   Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)

about steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may contact the Maryland Attorney General at:

For Massachusetts Residents. You have the right to obtain a police report and request a security freeze as
described above. The consumer reporting agencies may charge you a fee of up to $5 to place a security freeze
on your account, and may require that you provide certain personal information (such as your name, Social
Security number, date of birth, and address) and proper identification (such as a copy of a government-issued
ID card and a bill or statement) prior to honoring your request for a security freeze. There is no charge,
however, to place, lift or remove a security freeze if you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the
consumer reporting agencies with a valid police report.
