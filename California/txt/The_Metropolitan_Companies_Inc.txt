              (which include: Metropolitan Interpreters and Translators, Inc., Metlang LLC, Metropolitan Hospitality, Inc.,
              CTI Metropolitan LLC, and Metropolitan Temporaries) that may have resulted in the disclosure of your

               may have obtained your information if you were employed by or submitted an application for employment

              this incident may cause. At this time, we are not aware of any misuse of your information.

              What Happened?
              On April 21, 2014, our IT department discovered that an unauthorized third party may have accessed our
              computer systems and potentially removed documents. As soon as we discovered this situation, we removed
              all access to the systems, and engaged outside data forensics experts to conduct an extensive investigation.
              Through a complex review process, we determined that information, including your name, address, phone
              number, email address, Social Security number, date of birth, past education and work history, and certain
              financial information may have been accessed without authorization. This letter contains information about
              steps you can take to protect your information, and resources we are making available to help you.
              We want to assure you that we have taken extensive measures to strengthen our IT security and prevent this
              type of event from happening again. This includes increasing firewall protections, enhancing threat detection
              and monitoring capabilities, and improving other data security measures.

              What Are We Doing To Protect You?
