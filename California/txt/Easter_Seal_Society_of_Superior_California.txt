  To the Parents/Guardians of John Q Sample,

  I am writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the health record of your child.

  On December 10, 2013, an Easter Seal Society of Superior California (“Easter Seals”) employee’s
  vehicle was broken into and a number of items, including a work-issued laptop computer, were
  stolen. Upon learning of this incident on December 10, 2013, Easter Seals immediately launched
  an internal investigation, hired specialized data security counsel to assist in the response to this
  incident, and retained external forensics experts to assist in determining the scope of this event.
  These investigations revealed that although the computer was powered off, password protected,
  and not connected to the internet at the time of theft, emails containing the health information of
  certain Easter Seals clients and potential clients could still be accessed.

  While we are unaware of any actual or attempted fraud pertaining to your child’s health
  information, we nonetheless wanted to notify you of this situation so that you may take steps to
  monitor your child’s identity should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

  Although these investigations are ongoing, it has been confirmed that these emails contained your
  child’s name, date of birth, health care provider information, health care billing information, patient
  identification number and occupational therapy notes.

  We take the security of your child’s information very seriously. Following this incident we
  undertook a review of our internal policies and procedures related to protected health information,
  as well as the enforcement of our employees’ adherence to these policies and procedures. All                      *0101000000*
  necessary steps are being taken to ensure that this type of event does not occur again in the future.

  Out of an abundance of caution and in order to help you detect the possible misuse of your child’s
  information, Easter Seals has arranged to have AllClear ID protect your child’s identity for 12
                                                                                                              0101000000
