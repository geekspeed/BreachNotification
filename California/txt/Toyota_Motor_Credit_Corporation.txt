RE:     Account Number: 01234XXXXX

Dear JUDY DOE,

We are contacting you because we have become aware of a data security incident that involved some of
your personal information. On August 5, 2015, an unencrypted email containing customer information was sent
to a TFS vendor partner authorized to perform computer system enhancements. The email contained the
following information associated with your account: name, TFS account number, bank account number and bank
routing number.

We have no reason to believe that the email was intercepted, and the vendor has confirmed the email
has been deleted. We deeply regret that this incident occurred and want to assure you that corrective
measures are being taken to help prevent issues such as this from occurring in the future.

The privacy and security of our customers’ information is very important to us. To help protect our
customers, TFS is offering you one year of free credit monitoring through ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., an
Experian® company.
