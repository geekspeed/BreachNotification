Dear Sample A Sample:
We write to inform you of a recent data security incident involving the unauthorized access to
certain electronic information of Snelling Staffing, LLC ("Snelling") that may have potentially
exposed your personal information to others. This letter describes what Snelling has done to
address this incident and also contains information regarding actions you should take to prevent
against potential misuse of your personal information.
We discovered on January 24, 2014 that on or about January 20 or January 21, 2014, the
personal information of some employees and former employees of Snelling was inadvertently
made available on the Internet due to the errors made during the installation of a cloud-based
server at the home of a former Snelling employee.
Immediately upon learning that unauthorized access to the information had been made possible,
Snelling contacted the former employee and access to the information was disabled the same
day, January 24, 2014. We also took steps to confirm that any Snelling information in the
possession of the former employee was deleted and/or destroyed. We do not believe that the
information was disclosed or used in any other way by the former employee between the time
the individual stopped working for Snelling and the time that the inadvertent disclosure was
discovered on January 24, 2014.
We have conducted a thorough review of the information which was made available online in
January, as described above. The review revealed that certain information about you may have
been made available at that time, such as your Social Security number, drivers license number,
date of birth, home address, medical information, alleged criminal activity by you, and/or drug
test results. Currently, we are not aware of any misuse of your personal information.                0123456



You may wish to contact the three major consumer reporting agencies to obtain information
about placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file. A fraud alert indicates to
anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you may be a victim of fraud. When you or
someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an
existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the creditor should take steps to
verify that you have authorized the request. Placing a security freeze on your credit file will
prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing your credit report, which will prevent them
                                                          (OVER PLEASE)                            A0491-LV2
from extending credit. With a security freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps
when you wish to apply for any type of credit. Below is contact information for each of the three
major consumer reporting agencies. We encourage you to contact them directly to request a
fraud alert or security freeze:
