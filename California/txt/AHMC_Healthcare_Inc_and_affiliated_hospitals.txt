ALHAMBRA, Calif. – Oct. 21, 2013 – AHMC Healthcare Inc. said today that
protected health information for approximately 729,000 patients has been
compromised following the theft of two laptops from a secure office. The laptops
contained data from patients treated at the following AHMC hospitals: Garfield
Medical Center, Monterey Park Hospital, Greater El Monte Community Hospital,
Whittier Hospital Medical Center, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center and Anaheim
Regional Medical Center.


Although the campus where the office is located is gated and patrolled by security,
the thief broke into a video-monitored 6th floor office and stole two password-
protected laptops. AHMC notified the Alhambra Police Department as soon as the
theft was discovered on Monday, Oct. 14. Video evidence showed that the theft took
place on Saturday, Oct. 12.


The protected health information contained in the laptops includes patient names,
Medicare/insurance identification numbers, diagnosis/procedure codes, and
insurance/patient payments.


At this time, AHMC Healthcare Inc. has no evidence that the information has been
accessed or used in any manner, but because this cannot be ruled out, this notice is
being provided out of an abundance of caution and in order to comply with the legal
obligations of the hospitals. We regret any inconvenience or concern this incident
may cause our patients.


AHMC Healthcare Inc. is working with local law enforcement to recover the stolen
property. AHMC Healthcare Inc. had recently engaged a third-party auditing
company to perform a security risk assessment and is working through its
recommendations, and in that connection will be expediting a policy of encrypting all
laptops. In taking these actions, AHMC Healthcare Inc. is strengthening the high
standards it maintains for safeguarding protected health information.
