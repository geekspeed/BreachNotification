Dear <<Name>>:

We are writing to you about the disclosure of your medical billing information to one of our business partners. On
February 18, 2015, Providence St. Joseph Medical Center discovered that a Providence staff member inadvertently
sent your billing information to a company that handles billing for some of our physician medical groups that
Providence contracts with in Southern California.
As a result of the clerical error, your bill was incorrectly labeled Providence Saint John’s Health Center, instead of
Providence St. Joseph Medical Center – where you received services.
We apologize for any confusion this may have caused you, but want to reassure you that the billing company that
received your billing information is a trusted partner of Providence and is required to protect the privacy of medical
information according to federal HIPAA privacy laws. Because of this, we do not believe there is any chance that
your medical billing information will be used inappropriately as a result of this error.
We want to be transparent in what has occurred. The medical billing information that was sent to the billing vendor
included:
•	    Demographic information (such as date of birth, medical record/account number, etc.)
•	    Summary of charges and dates of service
•	    Social Security numbers
•	    The billing code for your diagnostic lab results.
We are working diligently with the billing company to remedy the incorrect billings and to refund any payments that
were made. Once all billing corrections are made, none of your information will be retained by the billing company.
If you have other questions related to this matter, please contact ID Experts, the data breach and recovery experts.
Representatives from ID Experts have been fully versed on this incident and can answer questions or concerns
you may have regarding protection of your personal information by calling 888-668-9189. ID Experts is available
Monday through Friday from 6 am – 6 pm Pacific Time.
Your Access Code: [ID Experts will insert]
Your privacy is extremely important to us and we apologize for this mistake. We are reviewing our processes carefully
and looking for the best ways to reduce the risk of this happening again.
Sincerely,



Maureen Shaw
Regional Privacy Officer- CA Region

                              Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information
1. Telephone. Contact ID Experts at 888-668-9189 to gain additional information about this event and speak with
knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.
2. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and
monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit
report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.
annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free
report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.
If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with ID Experts, notify them immediately by calling or by
visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.
If you file a theft report with ID Experts, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who will
help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a
consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Experts Recovery Advocate who will work on your behalf
to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly.
You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note
that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to
provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items.
You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.
3. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus
by phone and also via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures,
including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason,
placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information
for all three bureaus is as follows:
Credit Bureaus

Equifax Fraud Reporting                  Experian Fraud Reporting                 TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-525-6285                           1-888-397-3742                           1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 740241                          P.O. Box 9554                            Fraud Victim Assistance Division
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241                   Allen, TX 75013                          P.O. Box 6790
www.alerts.equifax.com                   www.experian.com                         Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                                  www.transunion.com
It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three
bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive
confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.

4. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying
information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will
need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind
that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card
until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. The cost of placing the freeze varies by the state you live
in and for each credit reporting agency. However, if you are a victim of identity theft and have filed a report with your
local law enforcement agency or submitted an ID Theft Complaint Form with the Federal Trade Commission, there
may be no charge to place the freeze.

5. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following
agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused
to file a complaint with them
