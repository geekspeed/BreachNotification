This letter is to notify you of a recent equipment theft of personal computers that involves the
Unemployment Insurance (UI) records of the Employment Development Department (EDD). A
locked, secure EDD facility was broken into and personal computers were stolen.

The EDD UI computers that were stolen had a secure login and were password protected.
However, since the computers were stolen and may have contained personal confidential
information of some UI claimants, we want to ensure that you were notified of the potential
access to this personal information so you can take steps to protect your information.

Some or all of the following personal information may have been in the computer records:

      Your full name,
      Social Security Number as reported to EDD, and
      Your last employer’s name, address and account number.

Enclosed is a Fact Sheet from the California Office of the Attorney General that explains the
steps you may elect to take to protect your personal information.

If you have any questions, you may submit your question online using Ask EDD and selecting
the Privacy category. Use this online address:
