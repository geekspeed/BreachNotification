Dear Employee and/or Former Employee:

The privacy and security of your personal information is of utmost importance to the City of
Encinitas and San Dieguito Water District, and we take significant measures to protect it.

Regrettably, I am writing to inform you that the City of Encinitas and San Dieguito Water
District recently were made aware that a Cal-PERS payment document containing social security
numbers with corresponding employee and former employee names had inadvertently been made
accessible to the public on the City’s website on or about May 13, 2014 to July 3, 2014. Based
on our research, we found the exposure has been limited to (16) people that accessed the
document during that period. Immediately after becoming aware, the document was removed
and is no longer accessible. We have taken necessary steps to improve our processes and
systems to prevent this from happening again.

The document contained information of employees and former employees who were enrolled in
Cal-PERS during the following timeframes:

      City of Encinitas – July 1993 – October 2011
      City of Encinitas Fire Safety/Fire Protection District – July 1986 – October 2011
      San Dieguito Water District – July 1989 – October 2011

While we cannot determine whether your information has been misused by any unauthorized
person, as a precautionary measure, we are providing you with a free one-year membership in
ProtectMyID AlertTM from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. an Experian® company to provide you
with world-class credit monitoring capabilities and in-depth assistance in identity theft
protection. ProtectMyID Alert is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not
hurt your credit score. Unfortunately, due to privacy laws, we are not able to enroll you directly.
Instructions on ProtectMyID Alert and how to activate your complimentary one-year
membership, is included as part of this letter along with your specific personal activation
code. (See page 3 of this letter)

In addition to the one year free service provided above, please be advised that you have several
other resources that are available to help you protect your personal information and suggest you
monitor your accounts for suspicious activity.
