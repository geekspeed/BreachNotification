Dear Sample A Sample,
                                                               Notice of Data Breach
We recently learned that Bristol Farms/Lazy Acres was the victim of a data security incident that affects the personal
information of many of our current employees and some former employees. We are providing this notice as a precaution
to inform potentially affected employees about the incident and to call your attention to some steps you can take to help
protect yourselves. We apologize for any frustration or concern this may cause you. We have arranged for you and other
employees to receive identity protection services for two years at no cost to you. Instructions for enrolling in these services
can be found in the What We are Doing section below.
What Happened
On March 30, 2016, an unauthorized individual, impersonating a Bristol Farms/Lazy Acres executive, contacted Bristol
Farms/Lazy Acres requesting certain information for Bristol Farms/Lazy Acres employees. Before it was determined that
the request was fraudulent, an electronic file was provided, which contained information about the affected employees.
What Information Was Involved
The file contained employee information including first and last name, address, Social Security number, and 2015
compensation and deduction information. Our investigation has found no evidence that this incident affected any of our
network systems or that any customer, vendor, bank account, credit card or other employee information was impacted.
What We Are Doing
We take the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously at Bristol Farms/Lazy Acres, and deeply
regret that this incident occurred. We have taken steps to address this incident, including promptly alerting affected
employees and working to investigate and remediate the situation. In addition, we have contacted law enforcement and
will continue to cooperate in their investigation of this incident.                                                                  0123456

What You Can Do
We want to make you aware of steps you can take to guard against fraud or identity theft. We recommend that you
carefully check your credit reports for accounts you did not open or for inquiries from creditors you did not initiate. If you
see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. If you find any suspicious activity on your credit
reports, call your local police or sheriff's office, and file a police report for identity theft and get a copy of it. You may need
to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records. Also, please review the Information about Identity
Theft Protection reference guide, included here, which describes additional steps that you may take to help protect
yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on
placing a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.
Some of the information affected by this incident could be used to file a fraudulent tax return. As an additional
precautionary measure, we also recommend that you file a Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit with the IRS to help
prevent someone from filing a fraudulent tax return in your name. For additional information from the IRS about identity
theft, please visit https://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft or call 800-908-4490. The California Franchise
Tax Board offers similar resources and forms that are available at https://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/id_theft.shtml or by
calling 916-845-3669. If you currently reside outside of California, there may be similar resources and forms to file in other
states, so we recommend that you contact your state department of revenue directly for more information.
Finally, we recommend that you enroll in the complimentary identity protection services that Bristol Farms/Lazy Acres is
providing. Enrollment instructions can be found in the What We are Doing section above.

inconvenience or concern caused by this incident.

                                          Information about Identity Theft Protection
We recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from
one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at
www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form
(available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA,
30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit
reporting agencies listed at the bottom of this page.
You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly
report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law
enforcement, your states attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may contact the FTC or
your states regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding and protection against identity theft:
Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580,
1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft.
For residents of North Carolina: You may also obtain information about preventing and avoiding identity theft from the
North Carolina Attorney Generals Office: North Carolina Attorney Generals Office, Consumer Protection Division, 9001
Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-9001, 1-877-5-NO-SCAM, www.ncdoj.gov.
Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on
notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be
placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert
stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have
already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your
credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit
reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page.

Credit Freezes:   You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no
new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A
credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you
place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless
you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may
incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing,
temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting
company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting
company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three
major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.
You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit
reporting agencies listed below.
