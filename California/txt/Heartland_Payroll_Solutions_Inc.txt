Dear <<MemberFirstName>> <<MemberLastName>>,
We are writing to tell you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information.
We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. That is why we are contacting you directly
to let you know how we are protecting you personally.

What Happened?
Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. (“Heartland”), was notified on May 8, 2015 that your personal information may have
been compromised. An incident occurred at our office in Santa Ana, California. Many items, including password
protected computers belonging to Heartland were stolen. One of these computers may have stored your Social
Security number and/or bank account information processed for your employer. We have seen no evidence suggesting
that the data has been accessed on the stolen computers or used in any way, and we have no reason to believe any
such use will occur. We have involved state and federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies to assist us in
determining how to proceed with the matter at hand. Heartland continues to monitor the situation carefully and has
increased its internal security and review procedures to watch for any unusual activity. We are providing this notice
to you out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to help protect your information from unauthorized
use, such as the steps detailed in the enclosed state notification requirements.

this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year.

                                             You’ll also receive “no activity” notices if there have been no changes to your data.
