Dear _______________:

On November 16, 2013, B&G Foods North America, Inc. discovered that an unauthorized third
party had earlier that day attacked the online e-commerce website associated with our Maple
Grove Farms brand. We are sending you this letter as a cautionary measure because we believe
that certain information about you, which may have included your name, address, telephone
number, and credit / debit card number, may have been accessed without authorization.

We regret this incident and immediately upon discovery took the affected website offline,
analyzed the scope of the attack, and implemented technical security measures to stop the attack
and prevent it from recurring. Nevertheless, we are writing to make you aware of this incident
so that you can alert your financial institution to have it cancel and reissue your card or take
other appropriate action.

For further information and assistance, please contact B&G Foods toll-free at 1-888-887-3268
between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

Additionally, we have enclosed information on steps you can take to further protect your
information.

B&G Foods takes this matter very seriously and deeply regrets any inconvenience or concern
that this matter may cause you.

Sincerely,

B&G Foods North America, Inc.



Jordan Greenberg
Vice President

                      Steps You Can Take To Further Protect Your Information

      Review Your Account Statements
As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you review your account statements and credit reports
closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial
institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any
fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your
state attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission. In some states, you may also obtain a police
report regarding this incident.

     Credit Report Monitoring
You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the 3 major credit reporting agencies once
every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by
completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request
Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at
http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf. Or you can elect to
purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies
shown below.

Equifax                              Experian                              TransUnion
(800) 685-1111                       (888) 397-3742                        (800) 888-4213

Atlanta, GA 30374                    Costa Mesa, CA 92626                  P.O. Box 1000
                                                                           Chester, PA 19022

     Additional Free Resources on Identity Theft
You may wish to review the tips provided by the Federal Trade Commission on how to avoid identity
theft. For more information, please visit http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-
4338).

     Fraud Alert
You may consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. This fraud alert statement informs creditors
of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to
establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the
three credit reporting agencies identified above.            Additional information is available at
http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

      Security Freeze
In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new
credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you
initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit
report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability
to obtain credit. Additionally, if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there
may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze; however, this fee may be less in
certain states (in MA, up to $5). In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the
consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security
number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, a
recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement, and, if you are a victim of identity theft, a copy
of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency. You must separately
place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency by sending a written request
to:

Equifax Security Freeze             Experian Security Freeze            TransUnion LLC
P.O. Box 105788                     P.O. Box 9554                       P.O. Box 2000
