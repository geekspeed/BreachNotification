              Subject: Security Incident
              Dear <<Member First Name>> <<Member Last Name>>,
              I am writing to inform you of an unfortunate incident that relates to your personal information. We apologize
              for any concern this may cause you, and are taking action to protect your privacy.

              What Happened?
              On June 3, 2014, we became aware that a thumb drive (also known as a USB or flash drive) containing data
              pertaining to X-rays provided between February 2, 2009 and May 13, 2014, was missing. This thumb drive is
              believed to have been taken from a staff member’s locker during a burglary that occurred on June 2, 2014,
              at the Santa Rosa Memorial Imaging Center located at 121 Sotoyome Drive in Santa Rosa, California. The
              thumb drive contained information pertaining to X-rays provided at this location by both Redwood Regional
              Medical Group and, more recently, by Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, which began operating the center on
              April 1, 2014. The thumb drive was being used by staff as a temporary back-up in preparation for migration
              of data from Redwood Regional Medical Group’s electronic medical records system to Santa Rosa Memorial
              Hospital’s system.
              The information stored on the thumb drive, as it relates to you, was limited to: first and last name, medical
              record number, date of birth, gender, date and time of service, body part(s) examined, name of technologist,
              and data related to the amount of radiation to produce the X-ray as routinely monitored and recorded under
              patient safety standards. Please note: There was no financial information such as a Social Security number
              or insurance information stored on the thumb drive, nor was there any diagnostic information.
              What Are We Doing To Protect You?
              In addition to reporting the burglary to police, we immediately searched the building and grounds for the
              missing thumb drive but have been unable to locate it. Following the discovery of the missing thumb drive,
              we immediately conducted an inspection of the facility and determined that no other thumb drives were being
              used for storage of patient information. We have also conducted an Information Security Risk Assessment and
              re-educated staff regarding the importance of data encryption and secure storage of patient information.




                                                                                                            Your letter is continued on the next page …
