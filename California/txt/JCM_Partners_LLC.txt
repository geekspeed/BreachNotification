Dear Family of John Q Sample,

JCM Partners (“JCM”) is writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some
personal information of your loved one. This incident may have resulted in unauthorized access
to personal information including your loved one’s name, Social Security number, driver’s license
number, email address and mailing address.

On March 6, 2014, JCM learned that a file containing personal information of housing applicants
was taken from a JCM database and posted on an unauthorized website. We immediately removed
the file from the unauthorized website. We launched an internal investigation to determine what
information may have been accessed by unauthorized individual(s). We retained an independent,
third-party security expert to assist with this investigation. Working with this security expert, we
also took steps to better protect the security of personal information at JCM. The investigation is
ongoing.

We take this matter, and the security of your loved one’s personal information, seriously. We have
not received any reports of fraud or identity-related crimes relating to this incident. Nevertheless,
we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your loved one’s account statements, and to
monitor your loved one’s credit reports for suspicious activity.

There are steps you can take to protect your loved one’s credit file. We recommend contacting the
three credit reporting agencies listed below to discuss your particular situation and obtain specific

                                                                                                              *0101012008*
guidance. Once you establish a relationship with the credit reporting agency and verify your
authorization to make a request on behalf of your loved one, you can request a copy of your loved
one’s credit report. A review of the credit report will let you know of any active credit accounts
that still need to be closed or any pending collection notices. Be sure to ask for all contact
information on accounts currently open in your loved one’s name (credit granters, collection
agencies, etc.) so that you can follow through with these entities.
                                                                                                        0101012008




You can also request, in writing, that the report list the following alert:

“Deceased. Do not issue credit. If an application is made for credit, notify the following
person(s) immediately:       (list yourself, and/or another authorized relative, and/or
executor/trustee of the estate—noting the relationship of any individual listed to your family
member—and/or a law enforcement agency).”
