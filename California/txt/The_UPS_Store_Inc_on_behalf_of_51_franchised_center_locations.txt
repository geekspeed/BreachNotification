To Our Valued Customers:
The UPS Store, Inc. (“The UPS Store”), among many other U.S. retailers, recently received a government
bulletin regarding a broad-based malware intrusion targeting retailers in the United States. Upon receiving
the bulletin, we retained an IT security firm and conducted a review of our systems and the systems of our
franchised center locations. We discovered the malware present at 51 locations in 24 states (about 1%) of
4,470 franchised center locations throughout the United States. As part of our response to this incident, we
have implemented various system enhancements and antivirus updates.
Based on our current assessment, we believe that information of The UPS Store customers who made
credit and debit card purchases at the impacted franchised center locations between January 20, 2014 and
August 11, 2014 may have been exposed. For some center locations, the period of exposure to this
malware began after January 20, 2014. The malware was eliminated as of August 11, 2014 and you can
shop securely at The UPS Store. The customer information that may have been exposed includes
customers’ names, postal addresses, email addresses and payment card information. Not all of this
information may have been exposed for each customer.
Your trust is important to us. Based on the investigation, we feel it is critical to notify our customers of the
potential data compromise. We are offering identity protection and credit monitoring services to those
customers who made a purchase at one of the impacted locations during the applicable time period. To
learn more about identity protection and credit monitoring services and for further information on the
impacted store locations, as well as the timeframe for potential exposure to this malware at impacted
locations, please visit https lltheugsstore allclearid corn.
We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit
reports. If you believe your credit or debit card was impacted by this incident, you should immediately
contact your payment card issuer or bank.
If you have any additional questions, please call us at 1-855-731-6016.
Please know we take our responsibility to protect customer information seriously and have committed
extensive resources to addressing this incident. We understand this type of incident can be disruptive and
apologize for any anxiety this may have caused.

Sincerely,




Tim Davis
President, The UPS Store, Inc.

                                 Additional Information

We encourage The UPS Store customers to take the following steps:

Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll4ree at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual
Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) website
at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports
only through the website, toll4ree number or request form.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your credit reports. When you
receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look
in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit.
Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The
credit bureau will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal
information” section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address
and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit
bureau at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a
warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the credit bureaus of any
inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the
information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are
accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit
bureau by telephone and in writing. Credit bureau staff will review your report with you.
If the information can’t be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved.
Information that can’t be explained also should be reported to your local police or
sheriff’s office because it may signal criminal activity.

Reporting Incidents. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report
the incident to law enforcement or your state Attorney General. If you believe your
identity has been stolen, the FTC recqmmends that you take these additional steps:
   • Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with
        or opened fraudulently. Use the FTC’s ID Theft Affidavit (available at
        www.ftc.gov/idtheft) when you dispute new unauthorized accounts.
   • File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your
        creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible
identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect
you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name.
When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant
gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the
merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert
on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will
reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert
at all three credit bureaus.

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a
“security freeze” (also known as a “ciedit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is
designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the credit
bureaus without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a
security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud alert, you
must place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau individually. For
more information on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide credit
bureaus or the FTC as described above. Since the instructions for establishing a
security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three nationwide credit
bureaus to find out more information.

The credit bureaus may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For
example, you may be asked to provide:

   •   Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, Ill)
   •   Your Social Security number
   •   Yourdateofbirth
   •   Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill)
   •   Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
   •   A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state•driver’s
       license or military ID card)

Dear [First_Name] [Last_Name],
We are writing to notify you of an incident that involves certain of your personal information. The UPS
Store, Inc. (“The UPS Store”), among many other U.S. retailers, recently received a government bulletin
regarding a broad-based malware intrusion targeting retailers in the United States. The UPS Store
discovered malware identified in the bulletin on systems at5l locations in 24 states (about 1%) of 4,470
franchised center locations throughout the United States. Upon receiving the bulletin, The UPS Store
retained an IT security firm and conducted a review of its systems and the systems of its franchised
center locations. As part of its response to this incident, The UPS Store has implemented various system
enhancements and antivirus updates.

Based on the current assessment of The UPS Store and the IT security firm, we believe that certain
personal information you provided in connection with establishing a MailBox Manager account at one of
the impacted franchised center locations between January 20, 2014 and August 11, 2014 may have
been exposed. For some center locations, the period of exposure to this malware began after January
20, 2014. The malware was eliminated as of August 11, 2014 and no longer presents a threat for
customers shopping at The UPS Store locations in the United States. The customer information that may
have been exposed in connection with the MailBox Manager accounts includes customers’ names,
postal addresses, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. In addition, we believe that
your name, postal address, email address and payment card information may have been exposed to the
extent you made credit or debit card purchases at the impacted franchised center locations during the
same time period. Not all of this information may have been exposed for each customer. Based on the
investigation, we think it is appropriate to notify you of the potential for data loss.

We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free
credit reports. If you believe your credit or debit card was impacted by this incident, you should
immediately contact your payment card issuer or bank. Because we value our The UPS Store
customers, we are offering identity protection and credit monitoring services to you. To learn more about
identity protection and credit monitoring services and for further information on the impacted store
locations, as well as the timeframe for potential exposure to this malware at impacted locations, please

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security
freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to
prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the credit bureaus without your
consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which
generally range from $5420 per action. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on
your credit file at each credit bureau individually. For more information on security freezes, you
may contact the three nationwide credit bureaus or the FTC as described above. Since the
instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three
nationwide credit bureaus to find out more information.
The credit bureaus may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For example,
you may be asked to provide:

      •       Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, Ill)
      •       Your Social Security number
      •       Your date of birth
      •       Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill)
      •       Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
      •       A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s
              license or military ID card)
