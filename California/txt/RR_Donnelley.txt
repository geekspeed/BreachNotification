Dear [Recipient Name]:

We take your privacy and the confidentiality of the information entrusted to us very seriously.
Despite our best attempts, there was a recent incident in which your personal information, in
connection with your participation in the Boy Scouts of America 2003 health benefit plan, may
have been compromised. We wanted to make you aware, as well as explain some options
available to you to protect you.

According to RR Donnelley, a print and mailing vendor that UnitedHealthcare uses, sometime
between the second half of September and the end of November, 2012, an unencrypted desktop
computer was stolen from one of its facilities. On December 3, 2012, upon discovering that the
computer was stolen, the vendor promptly filed a report with law enforcement, and because it
was entrusted with UnitedHealthcare member data as part of a Business Associate relationship,
UnitedHealthcare was also notified.

According to our vendor, the 2003 information contained on the computer was limited to your
name, address and Social Security number. We have no indication that this information has been
accessed, misused or further disclosed. The vendor is continuing to work with law enforcement
in an attempt to locate the stolen computer.

We deeply regret this incident and any inconvenience or concern that it may cause you. As a
precaution, we are offering you one year of free LifeLock® identity theft protection services,
which include proactive identity theft protection, identity theft alerts, address change
verification, annual copies of your credit report from all three national credit bureaus, and
comprehensive recovery services if you become a victim of identity theft during your LifeLock
membership. We have enclosed instructions for your convenience in registering for this service,
along with a Reference Guide that provides details about additional steps you may wish to take
to monitor and protect your credit.

As a further precaution, we recommend that you monitor your tax returns, health benefit
statements, credit card and other financial statements. If you notice any unusual activity, please
notify the related institution immediately.

We take this incident very seriously and are committed to protecting the privacy and security of
our member’s personal information. Our vendor is putting additional protections in place to
prevent such incidents from occurring in the future including reinforcing existing policies and
practices and evaluating additional safeguards.

We have established a toll-free hotline that you can call if you have any questions.
Representatives are available between the hours of 8:00am to 5:00pm Eastern Standard Time at
1-800-632-3203. Again, please accept our deepest apologies.

Order Your Free Credit Report
You are entitled to receive your credit report from each of the three national credit reporting
agencies once per year, free of charge. You may obtain your free annual credit report from each
of the national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling
toll-free at 877-322-8228, or by mailing your request to Annual Credit Report Request Service,
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Do not contact the three credit bureaus
individually. They provide free annual credit reports only through the website or toll-free
number.

When you receive your credit report(s), review them carefully. Look for any inaccurate
information and contact the appropriate credit reporting agency to notify of any incorrect
information, including accounts you did not open; requests for your credit report from anyone
that you did not apply for credit with; or inaccuracies regarding your personal identifying
information, such as your home address and Social Security number. If you find anything that
you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency using
the contact information on the credit report as soon as possible so the information can be
investigated, and if found to be in error, corrected.

Contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
If you detect any unauthorized transactions in your financial accounts, promptly notify your
credit card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud,
promptly report the incident to your local law enforcement authorities, your state Attorney
General and the Federal Trade Commission. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) recommends that you take these additional steps:

•   Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened
    fraudulently.

•   File a complaint with the FTC using the ID Theft Complaint Form (available at
    www.ftc.gov/idtheft). Your complaint will be added to the FTC’s Identity Theft Data
    Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible by law enforcement agencies for their
    investigations. Use the FTC’s ID Theft Affidavit (available at www.ftc.gov/idtheft) when
    filing a report with law enforcement or to address disputes with credit reporting agencies
    and creditors about identity theft related problems such as new unauthorized accounts.

•   File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors
    and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

You can learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft by

Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File
To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit
file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new
credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying
for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be a victim of identity theft. The
alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can report
potential identity theft to all three of the major credit bureaus by calling any one of the toll-free
fraud numbers below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag
your file with a fraud alert at all three bureaus.

Dear [Recipient Name]:

We take your privacy and the confidentiality of the information entrusted to us very seriously.
Despite our best attempts, there was a recent incident in which your personal information may
have been compromised. We wanted to make you aware, as well as explain some options
available to you to protect you.

According to RR Donnelley, a print and mailing vendor that UnitedHealthcare uses, sometime
between the second half of September and the end of November, 2012, an unencrypted desktop
computer was stolen from one of its facilities. On December 3, 2012, upon discovering that the
computer was stolen, the vendor promptly filed a report with law enforcement, and because it
was entrusted with UnitedHealthcare member data as part of a Business Associate relationship,
UnitedHealthcare was also notified.

According to our vendor, the 2003 information contained on the computer was limited to your
name, address and Social Security number. We have no indication that this information has been
accessed, misused or further disclosed. The vendor is continuing to work with law enforcement
in an attempt to locate the stolen computer.

We deeply regret this incident and any inconvenience or concern that it may cause you. As a
precaution, we are offering you one year of free LifeLock® identity theft protection services,
which include proactive identity theft protection, identity theft alerts, address change
verification, annual copies of your credit report from all three national credit bureaus, and
comprehensive recovery services if you become a victim of identity theft during your LifeLock
membership. We have enclosed instructions for your convenience in registering for this service,
along with a Reference Guide that provides details about additional steps you may wish to take
to monitor and protect your credit.

As a further precaution, we recommend that you monitor your tax returns, health benefit
statements, credit card and other financial statements. If you notice any unusual activity, please
notify the related institution immediately.
We take this incident very seriously and are committed to protecting the privacy and security of
our member’s personal information. Our vendor is putting additional protections in place to
prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, including reinforcing existing policies and
practices and evaluating additional safeguards.

We have established a dedicated toll-free hotline that you can call if you have any questions.
Representatives are available between the hours of 8am and 5pm Monday through Friday
Eastern Standard Time at 1-888-823-9198. Again, please accept our deepest apologies.

Sincerely,


Brian DuPerre
Chief Privacy Officer

Order Your Free Credit Report
You are entitled to receive your credit report from each of the three national credit reporting
agencies once per year, free of charge. You may obtain your free annual credit report from each
of the national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling
toll-free at 877-322-8228, or by mailing your request to Annual Credit Report Request Service,
P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Do not contact the three credit bureaus
individually. They provide free annual credit reports only through the website or toll-free
number.

When you receive your credit report(s), review them carefully. Look for any inaccurate
information and contact the appropriate credit reporting agency to notify of any incorrect
information, including accounts you did not open; requests for your credit report from anyone
that you did not apply for credit with; or inaccuracies regarding your personal identifying
information, such as your home address and Social Security number. If you find anything that
you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency using
the contact information on the credit report as soon as possible so the information can be
investigated, and if found to be in error, corrected.

Contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
If you detect any unauthorized transactions in your financial accounts, promptly notify your
credit card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud,
promptly report the incident to your local law enforcement authorities, your state Attorney
General and the Federal Trade Commission. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) recommends that you take these additional steps:

•   Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened
    fraudulently.

•   File a complaint with the FTC using the ID Theft Complaint Form (available at
    www.ftc.gov/idtheft). Your complaint will be added to the FTC’s Identity Theft Data
    Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible by law enforcement agencies for their
    investigations. Use the FTC’s ID Theft Affidavit (available at www.ftc.gov/idtheft) when
    filing a report with law enforcement or to address disputes with credit reporting agencies
    and creditors about identity theft related problems such as new unauthorized accounts.

•   File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors
    and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

You can learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft by

Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File
To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit
file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new
credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying
for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be a victim of identity theft. The
alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can report
potential identity theft to all three of the major credit bureaus by calling any one of the toll-free
fraud numbers below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag
your file with a fraud alert at all three bureaus.
