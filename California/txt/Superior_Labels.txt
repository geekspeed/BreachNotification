                                              NOTICE OF A DATA BREACH

To Our Customers:
Protecting our customers' information is of the utmost importance to us. We are notifying you that we recently determined
there was unauthorized access to our systems potentially impacting approximately 7,000 of our customers nationwide.
While we recognize that no company is immune to cyberattacks, we are committed to doing everything we can to protect
our customers.
What Happened:
Several reports of unusual and/or unauthorized activity after shopping with us were received from our customers in a short
period of time. As a result, we have been working in conjunction with law enforcement and a leading cybersecurity firm to
investigate these reports. Based on our investigation, it appears that hackers used a security vulnerability in the
WordPress blogging software to gain access to our order management system from November 3, 2015 to December 11,
2015. During that period, the hackers may have been able to access orders placed though our order management
system.

What Information Was Involved:
While we do not have direct evidence that your information was stolen, the information that was possibly subject to
unauthorized access includes your name, address, credit card number, billing and shipping address. Along with the
information you submitted in order for us to manufacture the product your ordered, this is the only information we maintain
about you.

What We Are Doing:
Within days of the reports, we removed the blogging software from our website and implemented numerous encryption,
website and additional firewall precautions while our investigation was ongoing. We hired a reputable information
cybersecurity company to identify potential security issues and resolve them as they are identified. We are using
companies that have helped larger firms like Best Buy, Walmart, UPS and Apple with information security.

What You Can Do:
In general, it is important to safeguard your personal information. Some easy steps you can take include watching for
possible phishing attacks (suspicious emails enticing you to click on attachments or links), avoiding calls or emails from
unknown sources that solicit your personal information and using trusted security software that is set to update
automatically. You should also remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. For
more information on best practices visit www.onguardonline.gov. You should also report suspected incidents of identity
theft to local law enforcement, your state's attorney general and the FTC. For more information, please review the
Information about Identity Theft Protection on the reverse side of this notice. If you notice any suspicious activity
specifically on your Rubberstamps.net account, please call our customer service center at 1-877-391-6369.

We have arranged for AllClear ID to protect your identity at no cost to you. The following identity protection service starts
on the date of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 12 months.
AllClear SECURE: The team at AllClear ID is ready and standing by if you need identity repair assistance. This service is
automatically available to you with no enrollment required. If a problem arises, simply call 877-313-1402 and a dedicated
investigator will help recover financial losses, restore your credit and make sure your identity is returned to its proper
condition.

For More Information:
While we are taking appropriate actions to handle this incident, I wanted to inform you of the situation personally. I take
security very seriously and value your relationship with us. We have established the following toll-free number to
respond to any questions or concerns you may have about this incident. The toll-free number is 877-313-1402.

I deeply regret any inconvenience or concerns this may have caused. The need to stay ahead of those who seek to do us
and our customers harm is an ongoing priority; we will continue to do everything we can to protect our customers and our
systems.

Sincerely,

Scott Lee

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on
notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be
placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert
stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have
already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit
report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the
three national credit reporting agencies listed below.
                                         Equifax: 1-888-766-0008, www.equifax.com

                                     TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, www.transunion.com
Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that
no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a
freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your
consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit
report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In
addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The
cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each
credit reporting company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit
reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the
three major credit reporting companies listed above to find out more information.

Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. The
following information should be included when requesting a security freeze (documentation for you and your spouse must
be submitted when freezing a spouse's credit report): full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; Social Security
number; date of birth (month, day and year); current address and previous addresses for the past five (5) years; and
applicable fee (if any) or incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The request should also include a copy of a government-issued identification card, such as a driver's license, state or
military ID card, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or insurance statement. Each copy should be legible, display your name
and current mailing address, and the date of issue (statement dates must be recent). The credit reporting company may
charge a reasonable fee of up to $5 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or
the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and have submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft to the credit
reporting company.
