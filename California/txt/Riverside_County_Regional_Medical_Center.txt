Mr.


Dear Patient:
Riverside County Regional Medical Center (RCRMC) is writing to you with important information
about the loss of a laptop computer that contained some of your personal information. The
Privacy Office at RCRMC was notified about the loss and the possible disclosure of patient
information on June 18, 2014. Our staff, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, and
Riverside County Information Security Office are actively investigating the incident.
The laptop was determined to be missing from a diagnostic services office in the hospital
sometime between 4:30 p.m. on June 17 and 3:30 p.m. on June 18. The computer contained
your name, date of birth, medical record number and the results of your nerve conduction study
(electromyogram). The names of your referring doctor and the doctor who performed your
nerve conduction study were also stored in the computer.
We have verified that NO social security numbers, health insurance information or home
addresses were contained in the computer. No other information about your healthcare was
disclosed and none of your other medical records at RCRMC have been compromised.
Providing you with high-quality healthcare and safeguarding your privacy are our top priorities at
RCRMC. We are taking immediate steps to enhance our computer security and further restrict
access to sensitive hospital locations to meet our goals of protecting the private healthcare
information of all our patients.
If you have any questions or concerns about your patient information I would be pleased to
speak with you. Please feel free to contact me, Christina Quijada, at 1-877-500-1255 or our
Riverside County Privacy Office at (951) 955-5757.

Sincerely,

Christina Quijada
Administrative Services Officer
