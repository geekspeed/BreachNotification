On May 28, 2014, we discovered that, earlier that morning, someone obtained unauthorized access to our
order processing system for ExpressVitals.com. The access was immediately terminated. However, this
incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to information obtained from you during a recent order,
including your name, address, credit card number, security code, and social security number.

We have investigated the incident and taken the necessary steps to prevent it from recurring as well as
mitigate its effect on you. We have notified and are continuing to investigate this incident with law
enforcement. We have also informed the credit reporting agencies and payment card networks about this
incident so that they may take appropriate action regarding your credit card account.

We recommend that you monitor your credit card transaction records and credit reports for fraudulent
transactions or accounts. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report maintained by each of the three
credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling toll-free 877-322-8228.
Review the reports carefully, and if you find anything you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the
appropriate credit reporting agency. In addition, if you suspect fraudulent activity, you can contact your
credit card company, local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, and the Federal Trade
Commission.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud
alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be
the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application.
Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts
all creditor access to your account, but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.
Enquire with the credit reporting agencies for their specific procedures regarding security freezes.
