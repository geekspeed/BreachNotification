Dear Sample A Sample:
We are writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of your personal information. Butler
University is providing this notice to ensure that you are aware of the incident and so that you may take
steps to monitor and safeguard your identity, financial accounts, and credit report, should you feel it is
appropriate to do so.
On May 28, 2014, Butler University was contacted by California law enforcement and alerted to an identity
theft investigation in which the suspect had in his possession a flash drive containing the personal
information of certain Butler University employees. Upon learning of this, Butler University immediately
notified the affected employees and launched an internal investigation. This investigation revealed that this
personal information could have originated from unauthorized hacking into Butler Universitys computer
network between November 2013 and May 2014. Third-party computer forensics experts were retained by
Butler University to confirm these findings and to identify the full extent of data potentially exposed as a
result of this incident. While these investigations are ongoing, we have determined that files containing
your name, Social Security number, driver's license number, and bank account information were accessible
to the hacker(s) during this time period.
Butler University takes this matter, and the security of personal information entrusted to it, very seriously.
To help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership to Experians®
ProtectMyID® Alert. This service helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides

To further protect against possible identity theft, fraud, or other financial loss, Butler University
encourages you to remain vigilant, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit
reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one (1) free credit report annually
from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major
credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a fraud alert on your file that alerts
creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note,
however, that because a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may
also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit
bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you
wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit report, please
contact any of the agencies listed below. Information regarding security freezes is also available from
these agencies.
