            Dear XXX,

            We are writing to you because of a recent security incident at the Department of Resources
            Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle).

            On January 23, 2014, the Human Resources Office (HR) was notified that the Leave Activity
            and Balances Report that contained your first initial, middle initial, last name, and Social
            Security Number were sent electronically to your Personnel Liaison.

            When we received notification of the incident, HR immediately contacted all Personnel Liaisons
            and instructed them to delete the e-mail and shred the LAB reports

            To protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you place a fraud
            alert on your credit files by following the recommended privacy protection steps outlined in the
            enclosure.

            For more information about identity theft, you may visit the website of the Office of Privacy
            Protection at http://www.oag.ca.gov/idtheft/first-aid.

            We regret that this incident occurred and want to assure that we have reviewed and revised our
            procedures to minimize the risk of recurrence. Should you need any further information about
            this incident, please contact Romana Herrera at (916) 341-6285.

            Sincerely,




            Tom Estes, Information Security Officer
