RE: Unauthorized Access to Advantage Dental Database
Dear Sample A Sample:
I am writing to inform you that your personal information may have been on a database that was accessed by an
unauthorized person between February 23, 2015 and February 26, 2015. We do not have any evidence that
identity theft has occurred. It is possible that someone may have illegally accessed your personal information.
The information may have included your name, address, phone number, date of birth, and social security number.
We are offering you free access to experts who are ready and able to assist you.
We learned of the illegal access on February 26, 2015. A regular security review showed activity that was not
normal. Further investigation showed that an unauthorized person accessed the database that stores your
information. We acted as soon as possible. We have been working with law enforcement to investigate. We will
take the necessary steps to protect your information.
These steps include looking at how we protect our systems. We maintain the necessary safeguards to protect
against improper access. However, criminals actively use illegal programs to get around these safeguards. We
made changes to further defend against these attacks. I can assure you that protecting your information will
continue to be important to our mission to provide excellent patient care services.
