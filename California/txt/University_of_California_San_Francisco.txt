                          Dear <<FULL NAME>>,
                          We are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of your health information. On September
                          25, 2013, UCSF learned that an unencrypted personal laptop was stolen from the locked vehicle of a
                          physician in the Division of Gastroenterology at the UCSF School of Medicine. Given the physician’s
                          various UCSF responsibilities, it was determined that the physician had the information appropriately.
                          UCSF immediately began a technical analysis to identify what information was on the laptop. On
                          November 13, 2013, UCSF determined that the laptop contained information that included your name
                          and some health information. The files may have also contained other identifiable information, such as
                          your date of birth or medical record number. The files did not contain your social security number.
                          We sincerely apologize that this has happened, as using an unencrypted laptop for business purposes
                          is against UCSF’s policy and practice. We encourage you to contact UCSF/ID Experts, who are
                          well-versed in this matter, with any questions by calling 1-800-981-7567 (international callers,
                          please dial 1-503-597-7671). While there is no evidence of any attempted access or attempted use
                          of the information involved in this incident, should an unknown person contact you, we encourage
                          you to not release any of your personal information. Additional information about identify theft may
                          be obtained from the following agencies:
