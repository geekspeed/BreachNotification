       Dear John Sample:

       We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have resulted in the disclosure of your
       credit or debit card information. We take the privacy and security of your information very seriously, and
       sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains
       information about steps you can take to protect your information, and resources we are making available
       to help you.

       On August 24, 2015, NorthShore Care Supply learned of a possible security incident involving its online
       ordering website. We immediately engaged independent IT forensic experts to assist with our
       investigation. While the investigation is still ongoing, it appears that your credit and debit card data may
       have been compromised if you made an online purchase between June 7, 2015 and August 24, 2015. The
       information potentially exposed includes your name, address, card number, verification code, and/or the
       card‚Äôs expiration date.

       Although we do not believe you are at risk for identity theft because the information at issue involves
       your credit or debit card information, we value you as a customer and have arranged to have AllClear ID
       protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on
       the date of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 12 months:

                                  AllClear SECURE: The team at AllClear ID is ready and standing by if you need identity repair
                                  assistance. This service is automatically available to you with no enrollment required. If a
                                  problem arises, simply call 1-855-229-0069 and a dedicated investigator will do the work to
                                  recover financial losses, restore your credit and make sure your identity is returned to its proper
                                  condition.

                                  AllClear PLUS: This service offers additional layers of protection including identity theft
                                  monitoring that delivers secure, actionable alerts to you by phone and $1,000,000.00 Identity
                                  Theft Insurance Coverage. To use the PLUS service, you will need to provide your personal
                                  information to AllClear ID. You may sign up online at enroll.allclearid.com or by phone by
                                  calling 1-855-229-0069 using the following redemption code Redemption Code.

                                  Please note: Additional steps may be required by you in order to activate your phone alerts.

       In addition to the steps we are taking, we suggest you monitor your credit or debit card and notify your
       bank if you notice any suspicious activity. Your trust is a top priority for NorthShore and we deeply
       regret any concern this may cause. The privacy and protection of your information is a matter we take


                                                                                                                ¬Ä,A.QAA^!^N	S+

very seriously, and we have taken steps to prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. This
includes rebuilding the e-commerce website on a new server and enhancing our website intrusion

dedicated to protecting your information.

more of the national credit reporting companies.           You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at

also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

When you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. Look for accounts or creditor inquiries that you did not initiate or do
not recognize. Look for information, such as home address and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything
you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.

We recommend you remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and promptly report
any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law
enforcement, your state‚Äôs attorney general and/or the Federal Trade Commission (‚ÄúFTC‚Äù). You may contact the FTC or your
state‚Äôs regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding identity theft.

The next 2 paragraphs are regarding incidents involving personal health information. Disregard if not applicable to your
situation.

We recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from your insurer. If you see any
service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at the number on the statement. If you do not receive
regular explanation of benefits statements, contact your provider and request them to send such statements following the
provision of services in your name or number.

You may want to order copies of your credit reports and check for any medical bills that you do not recognize. If you find anything
suspicious, call the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the report. Keep a copy of this notice for your records in case
of future problems with your medical records. You may also want to request a copy of your medical records from your provider, to
serve as a baseline. If you are a California resident, we suggest that you visit the web site of the California Office of Privacy
Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov to find more information about your medical privacy.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that
you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit
report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report
for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity
theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place
a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national credit reporting agencies listed
below.

Credit Freezes (for Non-Massachusetts Residents): You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security
freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to
you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report
without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your
credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In
addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of
placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting
company. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.
Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting
companies as specified below to find out more information:

     Equifax, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
     Experian, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
     TransUnion, LLC, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA, 19022-2000, www.transunion.com

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting
agencies listed above.

Credit Freezes (for Massachusetts Residents): Massachusetts law gives you the right to place a security freeze on your
consumer reports. A security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without
your consent. Using a security freeze, however, may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may request that a freeze be placed
on your credit report by sending a request to a credit reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail or regular stamped mail to
the address below:

     Equifax, P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
     Experian, P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
     TransUnion, LLC, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA, 19022-2000, www.transunion.com

Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. The following
information should be included when requesting a security freeze (documentation for you and your spouse must be submitted
when freezing a spouse‚Äôs credit report): full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; Social Security number; date of birth (month,
day and year); current address and previous addresses for the past five (5) years; and applicable fee (if any) or incident report or
complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Department of Motor Vehicles. The request should also include a copy of a
government-issued identification card, such as a driver‚Äôs license, state or military ID card, and a copy of a utility bill, bank or
insurance statement. Each copy should be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue
(statement dates must be recent). The credit reporting company may charge a reasonable fee of up to $5 to place a freeze or lift
or remove a freeze, unless you are a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and have submitted a valid
police report relating to the identity theft to the credit reporting company.
