Dear Sample A Sample:
U.S. HealthWorks is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of our employees information.
Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.
On April 22, 2015, we learned that a laptop issued to one of our employees had been stolen from the employees
vehicle the night before. The theft was immediately reported to law enforcement, and we immediately began an
internal investigation. On May 5, 2015, we determined that the employees laptop was password protected, but it
was not encrypted. After conducting a thorough review, we determined that the laptop may have contained files
that included your name, address, date of birth, job title, and Social Security number. Although we continue to
work with law enforcement, at this time, the computer has not been located.
We have no reason to believe that any of your information has been accessed or used improperly. However, in an
abundance of caution, we are offering you a free one-year membership of Experians® ProtectMyID® Alert. This
product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity
protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is
completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. Unfortunately, due to privacy
laws, we are not able to enroll you directly. For more information on identity theft prevention and
ProtectMyID Alert, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership,
please see the additional information provided in this letter.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause you. To help prevent something like this from happening
again, we are enhancing our procedures related to deployment of laptops and full disk encryption. We will also
implement a program of regular surveys or audits to help ensure compliance with U.S. HealthWorks laptop
encryption policy. If you have any questions, please call 1-877-238-2179, Monday through Friday, between 6:00
a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time (Closed on U.S. observed holidays). Please be prepared to enter the following
ten digit reference number when calling: 7777052715.
Sincerely,                                                                                                             0123456
