Re: Payment Card Compromise

Dear <Customer Name>:

Our company was founded on a commitment to absolute customer service and satisfaction. We
believe in transparency and clear communication. We therefore want to alert you that on July
23, 2014, we discovered that malware (malicious computer code) had been installed on our
server which compromised customer payment card information submitted with orders to our
company between April 27 and July 17, 2014. We have reported the matter to law enforcement.

It appears that the malware was installed on April 27, 2014, and that it was subsequently
detected, contained, and removed from our server by July 23, 2014. It appears that the malware
caused payment card data to be stolen on orders to our company between April 27 and July 17,
2014. The payment card data was comprised of customer names, mailing addresses, purchase
information, and credit card or debit card numbers. Since we do not use or collect debit or credit
card PINs or bank account numbers in our transactions, none of this data would have been
present in a transaction and would not have been affected by the breach.

Our site is now secure and measures have been implemented to prevent similar attempts in the
future. We are not aware of any connection between this breach and cases of fraud. We have
reported the breach to our merchant bank and to the three major credit bureaus in the United
States: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. We did not provide them your personal information.

We deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause you. We take the security of your
information very seriously and encourage you to contact us should you have any questions. You
can call us at 800-953-5499 ext. 5, email us at data@backcountrygear.com, or visit us at
www.backcountrygear.com/data-notification. In the meanwhile, in addition to the notification
advisories on the following pages, we encourage you to change the password to the account you
hold with us. We also recommend that you closely monitor your financial accounts and that you
promptly contact your financial institution if you notice any unauthorized activity.

Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may create. We know we are one of many
companies to experience a data breach, but we are frustrated on your behalf. We will do our best
to serve you as completely and as quickly as possible. On behalf of each member of our team,
thank you for your patience and loyalty.

Sincerely,


Michael Monson,
Co-Founder and Owner of Backcountrygear.com
