                        Re: IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>:

      I am writing to explain a recent security incident that may involve your personal information. Green
Tree Servicing LLC (“Green Tree”) has learned that personal information relating to some customers may
have been accessible in a security incident involving potential unauthorized access to certain computer
applications residing on servers operated on behalf of Green Tree. The personal information that may have
been accessible in the incident includes your name, Social Security number or other personal information
included on mortgage forms. We wanted to reach out to inform you of what we are doing to protect you and
what you can do to protect yourself.

      	 We take this issue seriously and have already taken precautionary steps to mitigate the possibility of
identity theft and other unauthorized use of your personal information and to reduce the potential for any
future similar occurrences. Although we currently have no evidence that your personal information was
actually viewed or taken in the incident, we continue to be alert for signs of data theft or misuse.

      	 As for precautionary steps you can take, we believe this letter provides you with the information
you need to protect yourself against the potential for identity theft connected with this security incident, but
please do not hesitate to call us at 877-332-6276 so that we can discuss this situation with you. We will assist
you in the steps you can take to protect yourself from possible identity theft and unauthorized use of your
personal information.

      Out of an abundance of caution, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of
Experian’s® ProtectMyID® Alert. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information
and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of
identity theft. ProtectMyID Alert is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt
your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and ProtectMyID Alert, including
instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional
information provided in this letter.

Here are some actions we recommend you take to protect yourself and resources that may assist you:

         You should be vigilant with your financial accounts for the next 12 to 24 months, for example, by
         carefully reviewing your credit reports and bank, credit card and other account statements. If you
         discover suspicious activity on your credit report, your accounts or by any other means, you may wish
         to contact law enforcement or the state attorney general and file a police report of identity theft. Also,
         please notify us of any suspicious activity.

         You may contact the fraud departments of the three major credit reporting agencies to discuss your
         options. You have the right to place a free 90-day fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert lets
         creditors know to contact you before opening new accounts. It also may delay your ability to obtain
         credit. To place a fraud alert on your credit report contact the three credit reporting agencies below.
