Dear [Name]:

During a review of certain processes in the Scripps College Financial Aid Office, we discovered
that an unauthorized individual not employed by the College may have had access to information
relating to your financial aid application. This information may have included your name, social
security number, date of birth, and other financial information related to the aid application. As
a precautionary measure and consistent with the law, we are sending notice to advise you of the
incident.

Based on our investigation, it appears that a former employee acted in an unauthorized manner,
during employment, by sharing certain application information with a financial aid professional
who was not employed or engaged by the College. The disclosure appears to have been for the
purpose of obtaining assistance in evaluating applications and preparing potential aid packages.
That conduct occurred intermittently between 2008 and 2012. We have not identified any
evidence suggesting that the information was shared for any other purpose or was disclosed
beyond that one unauthorized individual.

We immediately took action to protect you when we discovered that your information may have
been accessed, and we are sending this notice to you without delay. We eliminated the
employee’s access to the financial aid information that we maintain, and we acted to prevent
further access by the unauthorized individual. We also have reviewed our computer systems and
security and conducted interviews to assess the scope of the conduct. We believe the situation
has been contained for the following reasons:

    1. The specific method used by the unauthorized individual to gain access has been
       identified and addressed.

    2. It appears the unauthorized individual’s sole motive was to assist with the review of
       certain financial aid applications. We have no evidence suggesting that the sharing was
       for any other purpose.
    3. We have no indication that any of your information was shared with any other
       unauthorized parties or that there has been any unauthorized use of your data.

Your privacy and the security of the financial information you provide are important to us. We
have reviewed the College’s access procedures related to financial aid data and are taking steps
to further enhance security. While we do not believe that your information was misused or that
there is any continued unauthorized access to your information, we encourage you to remain
vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports for signs of fraud or
identity theft. The toll-free telephone numbers and addresses for the major consumer reporting
agencies are included below. You also can obtain information regarding fraud alerts and security
freezes from these sources.

Any suspicious activity on an account or suspected incidents of identity theft should be reported
to local law enforcement, the state Attorney General, or the Federal Trade Commission. The

website also has tips on how to guard against and deal with identity theft.

Student and parent privacy, confidentiality and security are very important to us. We apologize
for any inconvenience or concern that this causes. For your benefit, we have retained a company
with experience managing situations like this one involving unauthorized access to information
to answer your questions regarding this notice. If you have any questions related to any of the
above, please contact the Scripps College call center at 1-877-465-4815 between the hours of 7
a.m. and 6 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time Monday through Friday.

Sincerely,




Lori Bettison-Varga
President
