Dear [First Name Last Name],

I am writing to inform you about a health information privacy matter.

We have learned that on April 6, 2012, a Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco Peri-
operative Department employee inadvertently sent a report containing information about a
surgical procedure that is scheduled or is in the process of being scheduled for you, to a non-
Kaiser Permanente email address. The report can only be read by using specialized Crystal
report reading software, which is not commonly installed on personal computers.

The incident is currently under review by Kaiser Permanente. We have reached out to the
owners of the email address and domain in an attempt to get confirmation that the report
attached to the email was deleted and not read.

Patient Identifiable Information (PII) on the report includes your first and last name, Kaiser
Permanente medical record number, type of surgery scheduled or to be scheduled in 2012, your
surgeon’s name, and date of planned surgery if it has been scheduled. Your Social Security
Number (SSN) was not on the report. While we believe the risk is limited, there is a possibility
that the information on the report could be accessed if the recipient installs Crystal report
reading software. This software is not something most people have on their personal computers
because it is primarily used for business purposes.

Kaiser Permanente respects your right to file a complaint. If you have any questions, concerns
or wish to file a complaint with us, please contact us at 1-877-608-0048, Monday through Friday
from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (PST); (TTY 1-800-777-1370, Monday through Friday 7:00 AM – 7:00
PM, Saturday and Sunday 7:00 AM – 3:00 PM, closed holidays.) You also have the right to
contact the Department of Health and Human Services through the Office for Civil Rights at 1-
800-368-1019.

On behalf of Kaiser Permanente, we offer our sincerest apology that this unfortunate incident
occurred. We assure you that safeguarding your information is one of our highest priorities. If
you have any questions with regard to this matter, please call 1-877-608-0048, Monday through
Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (PST); (TTY 1-800-777-1370, Monday through Friday 7:00 AM
– 7:00 PM, Saturday and Sunday 7:00 AM – 3:00 PM, closed holidays.)

Sincerely,



Darlene J. Palewitz
