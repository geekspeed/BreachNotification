Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Dear (Name):

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have exposed your personal
information. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. This is why
we are contacting you, providing you credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services, and
informing you about additional steps that can be taken to guard against identity theft.

What happened? We recently learned that a number of our clients had 2015 tax returns filed in
their names without their authorization. We immediately engaged a digital forensics firm to help
us investigate whether our information system had been accessed without authorization. On
March 15, 2016 we received confirmation from the digital forensics firm that some client
information may have been accessed without our authorization. It is possible that your tax return
file may have been one of the files accessed.

What Information Was Involved? The information included your name, address, date of birth,
Social Security number and bank account number if electronic deposit or payment options were
used with your tax returns.

What Are We Doing? We are notifying you of the incident, providing you information about
steps you can take to further guard against identity theft, and will provide you credit monitoring
and identity theft restoration services for 24 months to protect your identity. We are also working
with the Internal Revenue Service/Criminal Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
protect your tax information and identify the perpetrator, and will provide whatever cooperation is
necessary to do so. The security of our system has been enhanced, making it more difficult for
similar incidents to occur in the future. Further enhancements will be implemented based on the
digital forensic firmâ€™s findings and recommendations.

What You Can Do: To help protect your identity, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect
your identity for 24 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the
date of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 24 months:

                           Information about Identity Theft Prevention

It is recommended that you remain vigilant for any incidents of fraud or identity theft by regularly
reviewing credit card account statements and your credit report for unauthorized activity. You may
obtain a free copy of your credit report from the following national consumer reporting agencies or
from the Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281, 1-877-
322-8228, www.annualcreditreport.com:

Equifax: P.O. Box 105139, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
Experian: P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790, 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), or your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward
preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, the
FTC, or your respective Attorney General. The FTC may be contacted at FTC, Consumer Response
Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-438-4338,
www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to
put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert.
You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been,
or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at
least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already
been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert
stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by
calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national consumer reporting agencies listed
below.

Equifax: 1-800-525-6285, www.equifax.com
Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, www.transunion.com

Credit Freezes (for Non-Massachusetts Residents): You may have the right to put a credit freeze,
also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your
name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit
freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without
your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able
to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit
freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In addition, you may incur fees to place, lift and/or
remove a credit freeze. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state. The cost of placing, temporarily
lifting, and removing a credit freeze also varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each
credit reporting agency. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your
                                                                                            4|Page




credit file at each credit reporting agency. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze
differ from state to state, please contact the three major consumer reporting agencies as specified
below to find out more information:

Equifax: P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
Experian: P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion: P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA, 19022-2000, www.transunion.com

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or
one of the national consumer reporting agencies listed above.
