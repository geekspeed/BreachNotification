                    JIMMY	  JOHN’S	  NOTIFIES	  CUSTOMERS	  OF	  PAYMENT	  CARD	  SECURITY	  INCIDENT	  
	  
CHAMPAIGN,	  Ill.	  (September	  24,	  2014)	  –	  On	  July	  30,	  2014,	  Jimmy	  John’s	  learned	  of	  a	  possible	  security	  
incident	   involving	   credit	   and	   debit	   card	   data	   at	   some	   of	   Jimmy	   John’s	   stores	   and	   franchised	   locations.	  	  
Jimmy	  John’s	  immediately	  hired	  third	  party	  forensic	  experts	  to	  assist	  with	  its	  investigation.	   	  While	  the	  
investigation	  is	  ongoing,	  it	  appears	  that	  customers’	  credit	  and	  debit	  card	  data	  was	  compromised	  after	  an	  
intruder	   stole	   log-­‐in	   credentials	   from	   Jimmy	   John’s	   point-­‐of-­‐sale	   vendor	   and	   used	   these	   stolen	  
credentials	   to	   remotely	   access	   the	   point-­‐of-­‐sale	   systems	   at	   some	   corporate	   and	   franchised	   locations	  
between	   June	   16,	   2014	   and	   September	   5,	   2014.	   	   The	   security	   compromise	   has	   been	   contained,	   and	  
customers	  can	  use	  their	  credit	  and	  debit	  cards	  securely	  at	  Jimmy	  John’s	  stores.	  	  
	  
Approximately	   216	   stores	   appear	   to	   have	   been	   affected	   by	   this	   event.	   	   Cards	   impacted	   by	   this	   event	  
appear	   to	   be	   those	   swiped	   at	   the	   stores,	   and	   did	   not	   include	   those	   cards	   entered	   manually	   or	   online.	  	  
The	   credit	   and	   debit	   card	   information	   at	   issue	   may	   include	   the	   card	   number	   and	   in	   some	   cases	   the	  
cardholder’s	   name,	   verification	   code,	   and/or	   the	   card’s	   expiration	   date.	   	   Information	   entered	   online,	  
such	  as	  customer	  address,	  e-­‐mail,	  and	  password,	  remains	  secure.	  	  The	  locations	  and	  dates	  of	  exposure	  
for	  each	  affected	  Jimmy	  John’s	  location	  are	  listed	  on	  www.jimmyjohns.com.	  
	  
Jimmy	   John’s	   has	   taken	   steps	   to	   prevent	   this	   type	   of	   event	   from	   occurring	   in	   the	   future,	   including	  
installing	   encrypted	   swipe	   machines,	   implementing	   system	   enhancements,	   and	   reviewing	   its	   policies	  
and	  procedures	  for	  its	  third	  party	  vendors.	  
	  
We	  apologize	  for	  any	  inconvenience	  this	  incident	  may	  have	  on	  our	  customers.	  	  Jimmy	  John’s	  values	  the	  
privacy	   and	   security	   of	   its	   customers’	   information,	   and	   is	   offering	   identity	   protection	   services	   to	  
impacted	   customers,	   although	   Jimmy	   John’s	   does	   not	   collect	   its	   customers’	   Social	   Security	   numbers.	   	   To	  
take	  advantage	  of	  these	  services,	  or	  for	  more	  information,	  call	  (855)	  398-­‐6442.	  	  In	  addition,	  customers	  
are	   encouraged	   to	   monitor	   their	   credit	   and	   debit	   card	   accounts,	   and	   notify	   their	   bank	   if	   they	   notice	   any	  
suspicious	   activity.	   	   Additional	   recommendations	   for	   protecting	   your	   information	   can	   be	   found	   at

                                 Recommendations to Our Customers

The security of our customer’s information is our highest priority. Please review the following to learn
about steps you can take to protect your information:

1.      Monitor Your Payment Card Statements

        We encourage our customers to always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious
        or unusual activity. If customers observe unusual activity on an account, we advise that they
        contact their banks and/or credit card companies.

2.      Monitor Your Credit Reports

        We encourage our customers to monitor their credit reports. To order a free credit report, please
        visit www.annualcreditreport.com. Call 1-877-322-8228. Or complete an Annual Credit Report
        Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) website at
        www.consumer.ftc.gov complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual
        Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The FTC advises
        that you do not contact the three nationwide credit reporting companies individually, because they
        are providing free annual credit reports only through www.annualcreditreport.com, 1-877-322-
        8228 or mailing to Annual Credit Report Request Service.

        Upon receipt of your credit report, we recommend that you review the “inquiries,” section for
        names of any creditors from whom you have not requested credit, and the “personal information,”
        section for any inaccuracies. Any unusual activity or information could be a sign of potential
        identify theft. If you observe such information, contact the credit bureau listed at the top of the
        report. Your credit report will be reviewed by the bureau staff with you, and if any information
        cannot be explained, you may need to contact the creditors involved.

3.      Fraud Alerts

        You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus at one of the three major credit bureaus
        by phone and also via Experian’s or Equifax’s website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow
        certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your
        existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you
        when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:


        Equifax                              Experian                     TransUnion
        P.O. Box 105069                      P.O. Box 2020                P.O. Box 2000
        Atlanta, Georgia 30348-5069          Allen, TX 75013              Chester, PA 19022-2000
        www.equifax.com                      www.experian.com             www.transunion.com

4.      Security Freeze

        You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security
        freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name
        without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to send a
        request to a consumer reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, or regular
        stamped mail. The following information must be included when requesting a security


1752291v.1
        freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information
        must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes;
        (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses
        for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law
        enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a
        copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank
        or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and
        current mailing address, and the date of issue. The consumer reporting agency may
        charge a fee of up to $5.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze and free if you are
        a victim of identity theft or the spouse of a victim of identity theft, and you have
        submitted a valid police report relating to the identity theft incident to the consumer
        reporting agency. You may obtain a security freeze by contacting any one or more of the
        following national consumer reporting agencies:

        Equifax Security Freeze           Experian Security Freeze       TransUnion (FVAD)
        P.O. Box 105788                   P.O. Box 9554                  P.O. Box 6790
        Atlanta, Georgia 30348            Allen, TX 75013                 Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
