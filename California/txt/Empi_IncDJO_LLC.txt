Dear Sample A Sample:
Recently you received an orthopedic product from DJO LLC/Empi, Inc. for your rehabilitation, pain management
and/or physical therapy. We are writing to notify you that on November 7, 2014, we discovered that, on that
same day, a backpack containing a laptop computer was stolen from a locked car belonging to a DJO consultant
parked at a coffee shop in Roseville, Minnesota. The laptop was password protected, but did contain some of
your personal information, which may have included patient name, patient phone number, diagnosis code, DJO
products received by you, dates the products were ordered and/or shipped, surgery dates, health insurer
names, clinic names, doctor names, doctor addresses, and doctor phone numbers. The laptop did not contain
your social security number, health insurance policy number, or credit card information. As part of our
internal investigation and work with a specialized company, we determined that, on November 21, 2014, all of
the personal information contained on the laptop was deleted. That means the personal information was only
contained on the stolen laptop between November 7, 2014 and November 21, 2014.
We are taking this matter very seriously and have conducted a thorough investigation. Please be assured that
we are taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the circumstances resulting from this incident and to ensure an
incident like this does not happen again. We have filed a police report with the Roseville, MN Police
Department. If you would like a copy of the report, you can obtain it by calling the Roseville Police Department
at 651.792.7008 and asking for a copy of police report number 14028420.
Importantly, there is no evidence to date that your personal information has been misused in any way.
Nevertheless, we care about the protection of your personal information and understand the concern that this
situation may cause you so we want to make you aware of the incident and present steps you can take as
precautionary measures.
First, if you receive a call from someone asking for your credit card information, or any other personal
information, in order to pay for clinical services or products, we suggest that you end the call and call the
applicable health care provider directly (e.g., your doctor or physical therapist) to find out if they were the ones    0123456

who made the call. Do not give out your credit card information, social security number, health insurance
information, or other confidential information to someone who calls you unless you are certain of that
individuals identity.
                                                                                                                       A6680-L01

                                                                 (OVER PLEASE)
Although no social security numbers or credit card information were involved in this theft, we suggest that you
place a fraud alert on your credit files as a precautionary measure. There is no cost to you to place this fraud
alert. A fraud alert requires potential creditors to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. A
fraud alert lasts for 90 days and can be placed by calling the three credit reporting agencies listed below. You
will then receive letters from all three agencies confirming the fraud alert has been placed and letting you know
how to get a free copy of your credit report. The contact information for each reporting agency is:
    Experian                             Equifax                          TransUnion
    1-888-397-3742                       1-888-766-0008                   1-800-680-7289
    www.experian.com                     www.equifax.com                  www.transunion.com

When you receive your credit reports, you should review them carefully. Look for accounts you did not open as
well as inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate. Also, you should look for personal information that is
not accurate, such as home address or Social Security Number. If you see anything on the report that you do
not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. If you find suspicious
activity on your credit reports, call your local police or sheriffs office and file a police report of identity theft.
You should ask for a copy of the police report, as you may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to
clear your records. Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, we recommend that you check
your credit reports periodically. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report a year from each of
the three credit agencies. You can also keep your fraud alert in place by calling again after the first 90 days has
ended.
We also recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement(s) that you receive from
your health care provider (e.g. your doctor or physical therapist) or health plan. If you see any service that you
believe you did not receive, you should contact your health care provider or health plan at the telephone
number listed on the explanation of benefits statements. If you do not receive regular explanation of benefits
statements, contact your health care provider or health plan and ask that they send you a copy after each visit
you make to your health care provider.
Please keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records or credit
information. Further information about steps you can take to avoid identity theft can be obtained from the
following sources:

We value all our customers and sincerely regret that this incident occurred. If you have any further questions on
this matter, please call 1-877-235-0796, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. (Closed on
