Dear Parent or Guardian of Sample A Sample:
Alliance Health is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our patients information.
Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.
On December 17, 2015, we became aware that a test database containing patient information had inadvertently
been left accessible via the internet. Upon learning this, we immediately secured the database and removed it
from public view. We also began an internal investigation and determined that your childs name, address,
telephone number, email address, medications and limited clinical information may have been included in the
database.Your child's Social Security number, credit card and bank account information were not contained in the
database.
We have no indication that any of your childs information has been used improperly.  However, in an abundance
of caution, we wanted to advise you of this incident. We apologize for this and want you to know that we take the
protection of your childs personal data very seriously. We have enhanced our security measures and performed
an extensive audit of all of our databases.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1-877-216-3862,
Monday through Friday, between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time. Please provide the following reference
number when calling: 6118020816.
Sincerely,




Sahily Paoline
