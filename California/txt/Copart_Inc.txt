Dear <First and Last Name>:

We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have affected information you provided to Copart. On March
31, 2015, we discovered that an unauthorized person gained access to our computer network. Upon learning of the
access, we quickly worked to block any further unauthorized access and engaged a leading cybersecurity firm to help
determine what occurred and assist us in implementing enhanced security measures. Based on the investigation, we
determined that the unauthorized person may have accessed your name, address, driver’s license number, telephone
number, e-mail address, and the username and password for your Copart.com account.

As part of our efforts to address this issue, Copart is requiring all members to change the password for their
Copart.com account. If you have not already recently been required to reset your password, simply sign into your
Copart account and go to the Change Password option under the My Account tab. Also, if you use the same username
and password for any other account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

We deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this may have caused. To prevent this from happening again, Copart
has implemented enhanced security measures to strengthen the security of our IT systems moving forward. If you
have any further questions, please contact us at (972) 391-5400, Monday through Friday, 7:00 am – 7:00 pm CDT.

Sincerely,




Sean Eldridge
Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer
