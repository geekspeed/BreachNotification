    RE: BIC Cards

    Dear Parent:

    We are writing to you because of a recent information security incident at the Department of
    Health Care Services (DHCS). In order to move your child’s enrollment to Medi-Cal from the
    Healthy Families program, DHCS mailed out your child’s new Beneficiary Identification Card
    (BIC). Unfortunately, a computer programming error occurred during this mailing. Because of
    this error, your child’s BIC card was accidentally mailed to the wrong person.

    The information in the mailing was limited to your child’s name, Client Index Number, date of
    birth, gender, and the date that the card was issued. Your child’s Social Security Number was
    not included in this mailing. Even though there is very little chance of identity theft due to this
    incident, we wanted to let you know because your child’s Medi-Cal identification card was
    involved. A new BIC card for your child will be sent to you before January 1, 2013.

    You may also have received a BIC card for someone else’s child. If you received a BIC card
    that does not belong to you, please place it in the self-addressed stamped envelope enclosed
    with this letter and mail it back to us. You can simply drop it in any mailbox or give it to your
    mail carrier. You will not have to pay postage.

    If you want more information or have any additional questions or concerns, please contact
    DHCS at 855-297-5064. Please do not call your case worker. Case workers do not have
    any information about this incident. Your case worker will not be able to help you.

    We want to assure you that we are reviewing our procedures to make sure that this does not
    happen again. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause you. DHCS will
    continue to work hard to keep you informed about your child’s Medi-Cal benefits.

    Sincerely,




    Karen Johnson
    Chief Deputy Director
