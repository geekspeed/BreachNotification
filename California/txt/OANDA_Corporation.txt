We are writing to inform you of an unauthorized breach affecting some of our clients, which
occurred on the morning of Monday March 3, 2014. Please note that this incident did not impact
the fxTrade services, client trades or funds. However;

A historical log of some payments we received via PayPal (prior to 2007) was accessed. No
passwords or personally identifiable information, outside of your name and email address, was
exposed.

Usernames and passwords for our “fxPense” expense reporting tool may have been accessed
(these accounts are not related to fxTrade). If you had registered for this service and use the
same username and password on any other external websites, we strongly recommend changing
those passwords.

Immediately upon detecting the breach, the means of access was disabled and OANDA has
alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), our regulators and the relevant privacy offices
to report the attack.

We have completed a careful review of our system services and logs, and are currently
undertaking an additional study of security across all of our systems, above our regular security
audits. This breach was limited to one server involved with historical data and was not connected
to our fxTrade system.

OANDA takes the protection of customer information very seriously, and we regret that this
incident occurred. OANDA is committed to working with you to help minimize any inconvenience
you may experience as a result.

We will provide further details as we confirm and learn any additional information. For additional
questions and concerns about your account(s) at this time, please contact our Client Experience
team by telephone (click here for a list of local numbers) or via frontdesk@oanda.com

Sincerely,
The OANDA Team
