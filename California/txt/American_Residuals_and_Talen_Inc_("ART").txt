Dear <<First Name>><<Last Name>>,

American Residuals and Talent, Inc. d/b/a ART Payroll (“ART”), a specialized payroll service in the advertising,
entertainment and events production industry, has had a payment or benefit reporting relationship with you, either
on-going or in the past. We are writing to notify you of a data security incident that may affect the security of your
personal information.

On October 18, 2014, we detected an unauthorized login onto our web application. We worked immediately to
contain the unauthorized access and prevent it from happening again. The unauthorized intruders had access to
the database for less than two hours. We launched an investigation and retained outside forensic experts to confirm
whether employee information may have been accessed. On November 10, 2014, our experts determined that your
information may have been accessed by the intruders. While our investigation is ongoing, it is possible that none of
your information was accessed or taken. We are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, but
we are providing notice of this incident to you out of an abundance of caution. The information potentially accessed
by the intruders includes your:
         •	 Name                                       •	 <<Date of birth>>
         •	 Social Security number                     •	 <<Email address>>
         •	 ART account number                         •	 <<ART account user ID and password>>
         •	 Address                                    •	 <<Telephone number>>
         •	 <<Bank account information>>
We take the security of your personal information very seriously. In addition to launching an investigation into the
matter and providing notice of this matter to you, we have analyzed our systems and processes and implemented
additional measures to secure your personal information. We’ve provided notice to the major credit reporting
agencies, and provided notice to certain state regulators and law enforcement officials. Additionally, we are offering
you access to a complimentary one-year membership to Experian’s® ProtectMyID® Alert. This service helps detect
possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity protection support that is

To further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review
your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled
to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus
directly to request a free copy of your credit report. At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a
“fraud alert” on your file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit
in your name. Note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also
delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your
fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should
you have any questions regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below. Information
regarding security freezes is also available from these agencies.
