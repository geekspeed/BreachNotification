Reset ICANN.org Website Login Password
05 August 2015

We are writing to inform you that ICANN has reason to believe that within the
last week, usernames/email addresses and encrypted passwords for profile
accounts created on the ICANN.org public website were obtained by an
unauthorized person.

These profile accounts contain your user preferences for the website, public
bio, interests, newsletter subscriptions, etc. There is no evidence that any
profile accounts were accessed or that any internal ICANN systems were
accessed without authorization. While investigations are ongoing, the
encrypted passwords appear to have been obtained as a result of unauthorized
access to an external service provider.

You are receiving this notice because your email address/username and
encrypted password for ICANN.org may have been compromised. The encrypted
password is not easy to reverse, but as a precaution we are requiring that
you reset your password. When you next visit our site, go to the login page
and click the forgot password link: https://www.icann.org/users/password/new
- to create your new password.

Most importantly, if you have used the same password on other websites or
services, you should change it immediately on those other websites or
services. As a general matter, you should avoid reusing passwords across
multiple sites.

No operational information, financial data or IANA systems were involved.

If you would like further assistance or information, you may contact us at -
icannorg-support@icann.org.
This notice was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

Thank you for your attention to this. Again, we deeply apologize for any
inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you.
