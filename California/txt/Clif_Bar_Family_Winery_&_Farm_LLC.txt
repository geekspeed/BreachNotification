You may contact the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement to report incidents of
identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more,
you can go to the FTC’s web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-

Monitor Your Payment Card Statements

We encourage our customers to always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or
unusual activity. If customers observe unusual activity on an account, we advise that they contact their
banks and/or credit card companies.

Review Your Credit Reports

You may periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover
information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the
credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal
law, you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three
nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to
www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit
reporting agencies at:

   Equifax                        Experian                    TransUnion
   P.O. Box 740241             P.O. Box 2020                  P.O. Box 2000

Fraud Alerts

In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about
fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your
credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name
because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to
obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit
reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the
other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact the
nationwide credit reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on your credit
report to prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without
your prior written authorization.
