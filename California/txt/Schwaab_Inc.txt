time period of January 22, 2014 and February 8, 2016.

caution, we are letting you know about the incident so you can take steps to protect
yourself.

During the time period that someone may have accessed our system, all credit card
information processed on our system was maintained on en encrypted server and was
protected by security protocols.

Upon learning about the incident, we immediately took steps to resolve the incident and
prevent the unauthorized access to our system. We also implemented additional security
measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack, to quickly identify unusual
activity, and to further protect the privacy of your information. We are actively working
with forensic investigators, state attorney generals and law enforcement. In fact, we were
required to delay our notification to you under the direction of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, so that steps could be taken to identify the individual who tampered with our
system.

We value your privacy and deeply regret that this incident occurred. We are taking this
incident very seriously and are actively continuing our investigation of the situation. We
will notify you if there are any significant developments.

           STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious
Activity. As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by
reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious
activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company
with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent
activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities,
your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. To file a complaint
with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).
Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse,
which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies.

Copy of Credit Report. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the
three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by
visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by
completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report
Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request
form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Or you can elect
to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit
reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for
the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is provided
below:

Equifax                  Experian                              TransUnion

Police Report. At this time, there is no police report relating to the incident. However, if a
WHD/12610583.1
report is issued at some time relating to this incident, you will have the right to obtain a
copy of the police report.

Fraud Alert. You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An
initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert
informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the
creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert
on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.
Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze. In some US states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your
credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of
a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is
designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your
consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to
obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each
credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the
consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name,
Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-
issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources on Identity Theft. You may obtain more information from
your state Attorney General, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, about how to
prevent/avoid identity theft. Taking Charge: What to Do if Your Identity is Stolen, a
comprehensive guide from the FTC to help you guard against and deal with identity theft,
can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/idtheft/idt04.shtm.
