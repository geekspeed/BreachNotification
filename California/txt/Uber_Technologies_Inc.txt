Dear Sample A Sample:
Im writing to let you know that one of Ubers databases was accessed by an unauthorized third party and that as
an Uber driver partner your name and drivers license number was contained in the database.
We discovered in September that information allowing someone to access the database had been available
without intended access restrictions. We immediately ensured that the database was no longer accessible using
that information and have taken additional safety measures to protect your information. Our investigation showed
that the database was accessed only once by a third party, on May 13, 2014. We have not received any reports of
actual misuse of information as a result of this incident, but Uber recommends that you monitor your credit
reports for fraudulent transactions or accounts.
To help protect your identity and monitor credit reports, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of
Experians® ProtectMyID® Alert. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and
provides you with superior identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of
identity theft. More information on ProtectMyID® below.
You may also obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies by visiting
www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling toll-free (877) 322-8228. Please review the reports carefully, and if
you find anything you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit-reporting agency for
assistance. If you suspect fraud, you can also contact your local police, the attorney general of your state, or the
Federal Trade Commission.
                                                                                                                        0123456

If you have any questions about this incident, please contact us at notice@uber.com or call us at (800) 870-8534.
On behalf of Uber, I apologize for this inconvenience and thank you for your partnership.
Sincerely,

                                                                                                                       A8434-L01

                                        Additional Steps You Can Take
You may also contact the credit reporting agencies directly to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A
fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and
that the merchant should verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on
your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account, but might also delay any
requests you might make for new accounts. Ask the credit reporting agencies for their specific procedures
regarding security freezes.
