Dear {RespFName} {RespLName} and Household,

We are contacting you about a recent burglary in our office that may result in an identity theft problem.
The theft involved computer equipment that contained patient insurance information that may be
compromised. We are actively working with the Riverside Police Department to fasciliate their
investigation and to resolve this incident as soon as possible.

We recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you
before they open any new accounts or change any existing accounts. You may call any of the three major
credit bureaus. A report to one bureau will notify the other two of a fraud alert.

             Equifax    ( 800) 525-6285
             Experian ( 888) 397-3742
             TransUnion          ( 800) 680-7289

If you do find suspicious activity on your credit report or have reason to believe your information is
being misused, call the Riverside Police Department at (951) 787-7911 and file a police report. Many
creditors require a report to absolve you of fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC
at www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft or at 1-877-ID-THEFT ( 438-4338 ).


We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.


Sincerely,


Dr. Robert B. Perry
Dr. Stephanie R. Perry
