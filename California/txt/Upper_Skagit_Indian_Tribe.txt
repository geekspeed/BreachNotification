Dear Sample A Sample:
I am writing to inform you that on November 29, 2012, the Skagit Valley Casino Resort learned that an
incident involving one of its vendors, Bally Technologies, Inc. (Bally), may have involved your personal
data. Electronic equipment in Ballys possession in the normal course of business for the purposes of
performing services for us was stolen from a Bally employees home office and may have contained data of
our customers. The customer data may have included your name, drivers license number, social security
number, and bank account information.
Circumstances suggest that the motivation behind the theft was to obtain goods such as electronic equipment
and jewelry, not information. We have not received any reports of actual access to or misuse of the data on the
stolen equipment.
A police report was filed, and we are continuing to investigate the incident with authorities. We have also
informed the credit reporting agencies so that they may take any appropriate action.
Even though to date we have not received any reports of actual access to or misuse of information, we
recommend that you monitor your financial accounts and credit reports for fraudulent transactions and
consider contacting the credit reporting agencies if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or obtain a free copy
of your credit report. If you see anything you do not recognize or understand, call the credit agencys number
listed on the report. Examples of suspicious activity include accounts you did not open, inquiries from
creditors you did not initiate, or an inaccurate home address. Contact information for the credit reporting
agencies is below should you have questions about fraud alerts or need help reading your credit report.
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285; www.equifax.com; P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241
Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742); www.experian.com; P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013
TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790,
Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
A fraud alert on your credit report does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. Instead, it alerts a
business that your personal information may have been compromised and requires them to verify your identity
before issuing you credit. As part of this verification process, the business may try to contact you directly.
While this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it ensures that someone
cannot fraudulently obtain credit in your name.
As you monitor your transaction records and credit reports, if you suspect fraudulent transactions have
occurred, contact your local law enforcement agency or the attorney general of your state. In addition, the
Federal Trade Commission web site at www.consumer.gov/idtheft contains information and tips to help
individuals guard against identity theft.
                                              (OVER PLEASE)
                                                                                                           88868-LV1
