                                  Re: Data Loss Incident

       Dear John Sample:

       I am writing to let you know that a device containing information regarding mariners who
       have served aboard vessels operated by Horizon Lines has been identified as missing.
       While we have no indication that the device has been used or was even intentionally
       removed, and while accessing any information on the device requires a valid user ID and
       password, we take the security of such information seriously and are accordingly writing to
       inform you of this incident.

       The device was first identified as potentially missing on or about December 7, 2015 and
       appears to have been lost between November 9 and December 7, 2015. While our
       investigation is ongoing, we have determined that among the electronic files contained on
       the device were ones containing individualized information of mariners who have served
       aboard vessels operated by Horizon Lines since the year 2000. Accordingly, we believe
       your personal information may have been contained on the missing device. The personal
       information on the device included names, birth dates, addresses, telephone numbers,
       emergency contact information, Social Security numbers, and in some cases bank account
       and routing numbers, photocopies of passports, Transportation Worker Identification
       Credentials (TWIC), Merchant Mariner Documents (MMD) and Merchant Mariner
       Credentials (MMC), and copies of certain fit for duty medical documents.

       The Company has reported the incident to law enforcement and is cooperating in their
       investigation of the incident. Thus far, we have found no evidence to suggest that your
       personal information has been misused. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, we are
       reaching out to you so that you are aware of the incident and can take steps to further
       protect your personal information.

       As an added precaution, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect your identity for up
       to 12 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the date
       of this notice and will be available to you for registration for the next 12 months.

                                    Additional Actions to Consider

Although we have not found any indication that personal information has been misused, as a precaution,
you may wish to consider taking some or all of the following additional steps.

You should remain vigilant for evidence of fraud or identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your
account statements and credit reports. If you discover suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or
suspect identity theft or fraud, report it immediately to your financial institutions.

If you wish to do so, you may review credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you
discover information arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting
agency delete that information from your file. Under federal law, you are entitled to one free copy of
your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may
obtain a free copy of your credit report by visiting www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877)
322-8228. You may contact the credit reporting agencies at:

For residents of Iowa, North Carolina, and Maryland:

State laws advise you to contact your state‚Äôs Attorney General to obtain information about preventing
identity theft or to report any suspected identity theft.

In addition, you have the right to contact the Federal Trade Commission (‚ÄúFTC‚Äù) or law enforcement to
report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity
theft. To learn more, you can contact the FTC at:

If interested, you can also visit http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/idtheft/idt04.pdf to review an
online copy of ‚ÄúTaking Charge: What to Do If Your Identity Is Stolen,‚Äù a comprehensive guide from the
FTC to help you guard against and deal with identity theft.
                                                                                ¬Ä*A&qAC^)^OQ+

You also may obtain additional information from the FTC and the nationwide credit reporting agencies
about fraud alerts and security freezes. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit
in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay
your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert by calling one of the nationwide credit
reporting agencies listed above. When that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two
agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. A security freeze is another fraud
prevention tool that prohibits anyone from accessing your credit history without your authorization.
There is normally a fee for obtaining a security freeze, which is generally waived if you are a victim of
identity theft. If you request a security freeze, you must unfreeze your credit file before applying for
credit or other services that require accessing your credit history. You should be aware that placing a
security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of requests
you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

For Incidents Involving Personal Health Information:

We recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from
your insurer. If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at
the number on the statement. If you do not receive regular explanation of benefits statements, contact
your provider and request them to send such statements following the provision of services in your name
or number.

You may want to order copies of your credit reports and check for any medical bills that you do not
recognize. If you find anything suspicious, call the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the
report. Keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records.
You may also want to request a copy of your medical records from your provider, to serve as a baseline.
If you are a California resident, we suggest that you visit the web site of the California Office of Privacy
Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov to find more information about your medical privacy.
