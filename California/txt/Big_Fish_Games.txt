I am writing to inform you of an incident we self-discovered on January 12, 2015, involving the theft of payment
information from our online stores. An unknown criminal installed malware on the billing and payment pages of our
websites that appears to have intercepted customer payment information. Your information may have been affected
if you entered new payment details on our websites (rather than using a previously saved profile) for purchases
between December 24, 2014 and January 8, 2015. Your name, address, and payment card information, including the
card number, expiration date, and CVV2 code, may have been among the information accessed.


We have taken the necessary steps to remove the malware and prevent it from being reinstalled. We have reported
the incident to and are cooperating with law enforcement. We have also informed the credit reporting agencies and
payment card networks about this incident so that they may take appropriate action regarding your card account.


We value the trust and confidence of our customers, and take the protection of your information seriously. To help
protect your identity, we are offering a   complimentary one-year membership to Experians®     ProtectMyID® Alert.
This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with superior identity

The credit reporting agencies also provide information on how to avoid identity theft and what to do if you believe
your identity has been stolen. Although payment card information should not enable a third party to create new
accounts in your name, you should be aware that you can limit new accounts by contacting the credit reporting
agencies directly to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze.
