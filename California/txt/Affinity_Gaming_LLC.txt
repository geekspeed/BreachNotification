        Affinity Gaming Provides Public Notice of Data Security Incident
  Gaming Fncility Patrons Encouraged to Take Steps to Protect Identity and Financial Information

LAS VEGAS, December 20, 2013 — Affinity Gaming ("Affinity") has confirmed an
unauthorized intrusion into the system that processes customer credit and debit cards for its
casinos, and is issuing this public notice of the data security incident and encouraging individuals
who visited its gaming facilities between March 14th and October 16th of 2013 to take steps to
protect their identities and financial information. Affinity regrets any inconvenience this
incident may cause and has established a confidential, toll-free inquiry line to assist its
customers.

Affinity has also confirmed an unauthorized intrusion into the system that processes credit and
debit cards at its Primm Center Gas Station in Primm, Nevada. This intrusion began on an
unknown date and it ended on November 29, 2013.

On October 24, 2013, Affinity was contacted by law enforcement regarding fraudulent charges
which may have been linked to a data breach in Affinity's system. Affinity immediately initiated
a thorough investigation, supported by third-party data forensics experts who determined the
nature and scope of the compromise, and confirmed that Affinity's system has been fully secured
and that its customer payments are protected. On November 14, 2013, Affinity posted notice of
this incident on its website.

Affinity's investigation, while ongoing, has also determined that its system became infected by
malware, which resulted in a compromise of credit card, and debit card, information from
individuals who visited its gaming facilities: Silver Sevens Hotel &Casino in Las Vegas, NV;
Rail City Casino in Sparks, NV; Primm Valley Resort &Casino in Primm, NV; Buffalo Bill's
Resort &Casino in Primm, NV; Whiskey Pete's Hotel &Casino in Primm, NV; Lakeside Hotel-
Casino in Osceola, IA; St. Jo Frontier Casino in St. Joseph, MO; Mark Twain Casino in
LaGrange, MO; Golden Gates Casino in Black Hawk, CO; Golden Gulch Casino in Black Hawk,
CO and, Mardi Gras Casino in Black Hawk, CO. Credit or debit card data was exposed at these
locations between March 14th and October 16th of 2013.

Affinity encourages its patrons to protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss by
reviewing account statements for any unusual activity, notifying their credit card companies, and
monitoring their credit reports. Under U.S. law, individuals are entitled to one free credit report
annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To obtain a free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free,(877)322-8228.

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a "fraud alert" on your file that alerts
creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name.
Please note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it
may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as
one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your
file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your
credit report, please contact any one of the following agencies: Equifax P.O. Box 105069,

2000, 800-680-7289, www.transunion.com. Information regarding security freezes may also be
obtained from these sources.

The Federal Trade Commission(FTC)also encourages those who discover that their information
has been misused to file a complaint with them. To file a complaint with the FTC, or to obtain
