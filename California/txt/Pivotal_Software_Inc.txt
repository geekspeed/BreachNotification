We are following up with you about the recent incident at Pivotal that involved your personal
information.

WHAT HAPPENED. As we stated earlier, Pivotal was recently involved in an e-mail “phishing” scam
targeting personal information of Pivotal employees. On March 22, 2016, an unknown third party sent a
fraudulent email message impersonating CEO Rob Mee to an employee requesting certain information
about Pivotal employees. The employee responded to the request, mistakenly believing that it came from
Mr. Mee.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED. We began investigating the incident as soon as we
learned of it. We have determined that the personal information involved in this incident included a copy
of your 2015 Form W-2, which includes your name, address, 2015 income information and Social
Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

WHAT WE ARE DOING. Pivotal immediately took steps to investigate the incident, to track down
where the information may have gone and to attempt to prevent further access to it. We notified law
enforcement and contacted the IRS, and we are continuing to investigate the matter.

WHAT YOU CAN DO. We recommend that you review the information provided in our earlier email
and below for some steps that you may take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your personal
information.

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your
account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity
on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial
institutions.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement, including your
Attorney General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect
yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC’s website, at
www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade
Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you
discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that
the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal
law, you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three
nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to
www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit
reporting agencies at:

Equifax                          Experian                          TransUnion
(800) 525-6285                   (888) 397-3742                    (800) 916-8800
P.O. Box 740241                  P.O. Box 9701                     Fraud Victim Assistance Division

You may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts
and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit
information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it
tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain
credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting
agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two
agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.

In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a
security freeze to restrict access to your credit report:

    (1) Equifax – (800) 349-9960
    (2) Experian – (888) 397-3742

    (3) TransUnion – (888) 909-8872

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal
information. The fee to place a credit freeze varies based on where you live. After receiving your
request, each credit reporting agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or
password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password
in a safe place.

FOR MORE INFORMATION. Please know that we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident
may cause you. Please do not hesitate to email W2@pivotal.io or call 1-855-731-6020 if you have any
questions or concerns.

                                                Sincerely,

                                                Joe Militello and Drew Kramer
