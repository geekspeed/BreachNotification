Dear XXXXXX:

I am writing to advise you that your personally identifiable information (“Information”) may
have been viewed by a former employee of Sprechman & Associates without permission.
Specifically, the former employee may have viewed your name, address, date of birth, driver’s
license number, and/or social security number. Sprechman & Associates learned of this incident
in July 2012, but was unable to notify you until now because notification at that time may have
interfered with a law enforcement investigation and the best known contact information for
potentially affected individuals was not known until October 2012. Although we cannot be sure
that your Information was in fact used in an inappropriate manner, in an abundance of caution
we are informing you that such viewing of your information may have occurred.

What Information May Have Been Viewed, When and By Whom?

One of our employees may have performed unauthorized searches on you. This information may
have included your name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, and social security
number. We are advising you of this matter in an abundance of caution, but we stress that we
cannot be sure that your Information was in fact used in an inappropriate manner. In fact, we
cannot even be sure that your Information was actually viewed, but we are providing this notice
out of an abundance of caution.

How Have We Responded to This Issue

Nonetheless, we certainly understand that this may be cause for concern. Additional information
and support resources are available through the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center at
www.idtheftcenter.org, by calling (858) 693-7935, or via e-mail at itrc@idtheftcenter.org.

Other Steps You Can Take:

Obtain and Review Your Credit Reports Carefully
You may receive a copy of your credit report from any of the following three credit bureaus: (1)
Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX, 75013, 1-800-397-3742, www.experian.com; (2) Equifax,
P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA, 30374, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com; (3) TransUnion, 2
Baldwin Place, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA, 19022, 1-800-888-4213, www.transunion.com.

When you receive your credit reports, please review them carefully. While we do not believe
that your Information was used to inappropriately obtain or use your credit, you should still look
for inquiries you did not initiate, accounts you did not open and unexplained debts on the
accounts you opened. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify
the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. Contact information for the three
national credit bureaus will be included with your report.

For Inaccuracies and Notify Credit Bureaus of Them
While we do not believe that your Information was used to inappropriately obtain or use your
credit, you also should check to see that information such as your most recent address(es), first
and last names and middle initial are correct. Errors in this information can be warning signs of
possible identity theft. You should notify the credit bureaus of all inaccuracies as soon as
possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. Contact
information for the three national credit bureaus will be included with your report.

Keep in mind, however, that inaccuracies in this information also may be due to simple mistakes.
Nevertheless, if there are any inaccuracies in your reports, whether due to fraud or error, you
should notify the credit bureaus as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if
found to be in error, corrected.

Monitor Your Credit Report
While we do not believe that your Information was used to inappropriately obtain or use your
credit, you should continue to check your credit reports frequently for the next year, to make sure
no new fraudulent activity has occurred.

Report Errors and Suspicious Activity to Your Creditors As Soon As Possible.
While we do not believe that your Information was used to inappropriately obtain or use your
credit, if you have discovered errors or suspicious activity on your credit report, you should
consider immediately contacting any credit card companies with whom you have an account and
tell them that you have received this letter. You should make sure the address they have on file is
your current address and that any charges on the account were made by you. If you have not
already done so, you should consider adding a personal identification number, or PIN, to your
credit accounts. This will serve as an additional tool to protect your account and help the credit
card company ensure they are only processing changes authorized by you.

Place a Security Alert on Your Credit Reports
We recommend before requesting a security alert that you review all items on your credit reports
for inaccuracies. Although a security alert service will warn potential creditors to take additional
precautions when reviewing your credit records or applications for additional credit, be aware
that it could take longer for you to obtain new credit. If you want to renew the security alerts, the
three national credit bureaus will require you to contact each organization separately.

We hope this information is helpful to you and we sincerely regret any inconvenience this may
cause you. Should you have any questions please feel free to contact the Notice Department at
Sprechman & Associates, P.A., at (866) 849-5444.

Sincerely,



Notice Department
