Important Notice Regarding Hanmi Bank Profit Sharing & 401(k) Savings Plan

Dear [Plan Participant Name]:

Ascensus, the recordkeeper for Hanmi Bank Profit Sharing & 401(k) Savings Plan, is writing to
notify you that on July 29, 2014, Ascensus inadvertently sent a report containing your name,
birth date, address and Social Security number to a client other than Myung Hee Kim.
Although the client’s plan administrator did open the report, she confirmed to Ascensus—in
writing—that she deleted it immediately upon identifying that it was not for participants in her
plan, and that no other individuals at her company viewed or had access to the report.

Ascensus takes data security very seriously and we have a number of policies and procedures
designed to protect your personal data. In light of this occurrence, we are evaluating additional
steps that we can take to ensure that this does not happen again.

Although we do not believe that your data is at risk to identity theft, as a proactive measure we
are offering a complimentary 12-month identity protection package through TrustedID.
TrustedID’s comprehensive and proactive identity protection services include the following.

•   Free credit reports from all three major credit bureaus
•   Fraud flags with each credit bureau to ensure no new accounts are opened in your name
    without your permission
•   End user access to identity theft restoration specialists, who will help through all aspects of
    correcting damage done by new cases of identity theft
•   $1,000,000 warranty protection

We encourage you to take a few minutes to take advantage of this offer. To enroll in the free
identity protection service, go to www.trustedid.com/benefits. Please refer to the following
promotional code when enrolling: MKDIN57384.

In general, we recommend that you remain vigilant to the possibility of identity theft by
reviewing your credit card, bank, and other account statements and monitoring your free credit
report for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of
charge, directly from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your
annual free report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll free at 1-877-322-8228, or
