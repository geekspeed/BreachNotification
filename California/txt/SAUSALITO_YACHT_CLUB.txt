                                                   To all SYC members:
         We are writing to you because of an incident at the Sausalito Yacht Club on or about
         October 1, 2014,wherein several members gained unauthorized access to our member
         roster, which includes information linking your name to your private Sausalito Yacht
         Club member number, the combination of which allows you to charge beverages,
         goods, services and meals at the club, such amounts being charged at the time and
         accumulated for inclusion on your next bill.
            The data to which unauthorized access occurred also included your personal
            contact information, and in certain cases, sensitive financial account information,
            including accounts receivable that were overdue by sixty days or more. As best we
            can tell, no bank account information or credit card information was involved in
            this breach.

             We sincerely regret any inconvenience that you might encounter as a result of this
             intrusive and thoughtless breach of privacy, which is under investigation at this
             time.

             To protect you from the possibility of identity theft, Sausalito Yacht Club may elect
             to issue new cards and account numbers, depending upon the outcome of the
             investigation. We are also undertaking steps to strengthen access to sensitive
             financial and membership sites with new passwords required for access by
             authorized users. In the interim, we urge you to scrutinize your statements
             carefully and ensure that charges recorded were actually incurred by you. If you
             notice any unusual charge please contact the General Manager, Dave Martel by
             telephone at at 415-332-7400 or by e-mail atgm@sausalitoyachtclub.org.

             For more information on identity theft, we suggest that you visit the web site of
             the California Office of Privacy Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov.


            Sincerely,
            Bryan Lawton, Chairman Executive Board
