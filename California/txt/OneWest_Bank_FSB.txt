Dear [VALUED CUSTOMER]:

We recently learned that one of our service providers, was the victim of an illegal and unauthorized
intrusion into its network (“Network Intrusion”) during the first quarter of 2011. In response, the
service provider enhanced the security of its network systems, cooperated with law enforcement
including the United States Secret Service (“USSS”), and investigated using leading outside security
firms. Given the size and complexity of the issues, they have continued to investigate the scope and
extent of the Network Intrusion. As a result, the service provider recently notified us that they have
determined that an unauthorized person had access to files which contain some or all of the following
information about you: name, address, birthdate, phone number, drivers license number, passport
number, and Social Security Number.



While we do not believe that the person who gained unauthorized access to your personal information
copied or downloaded that information, to protect against possible identity theft or other financial
loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account statements and to monitor your
credit reports. We are providing the following information for those who wish to consider it:

        U.S. residents are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the
        three major credit bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit
        www.annualcreditreport.comor call toll-free (877) 322-8228. Remain vigilant over the next
        12 to 24 months and promptly report incidents of suspected identity theft to us and the
        appropriate law enforcement agency. The Federal Trade Commission has compiled helpful
        information on steps you can follow to avoid or detect identity theft. You can visit their
        website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/or call their hotline at 1-877-438-
        4338.

        The names and contact information for the three major U.S. credit bureaus are below. At no
        charge, you can have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert” on your file. This would alert
        creditors to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name.
        This service can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. Note,
        however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it also may
        delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one
        credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your
        file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your
        credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below.

         identity theft. Your state Attorney General may also have advice on preventing identity theft,
         and you should report instances of known or suspected identity theft to law enforcement, your
         State Attorney General, and the FTC.
