Dear FirstName LastName,

On June 11, 2012, a kiosk mail box located at the California Correctional Health Care
Services (CCHCS) Regional Administration building in Fresno, California was
discovered to have been broken into. Mail that may have been lost included
prospective employment candidate responses to employment inquiries with
personally identifiable information contained in California State Employment
Application forms and applicable documents. This information may have included
name, social security number, driverâ€™s license number, residential address, date of
birth, telephone number, e-mail address, and employment and education history of
prospective candidates.

Upon discovery of the mail theft, CCHCS immediately proceeded to report it to law
enforcement authorities and redirect incoming mail to a new locally owned USPS
mail box address. Steps have been taken to ensure no further mail is to be delivered to
the incident location.

Based upon the nature of this event, you may wish to monitor your credit by

caused.
