Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>:
OneStopParking is writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal
information.
What Happened? On December 25, 2014 we learned of a potential exposure of personal information provided to
OneStopParking. We immediately began an internal investigation into this issue and were able to remediate the
issue by December 31, 2014. Independent forensic investigators were retained to assist with this investigation. Our
investigation has determined that customers who used our website between August 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014
may have been impacted by this incident. Unfortunately we are not able to determine which specific individuals
may have been affected by this incident. While we cannot determine exactly what information may have been
compromised, the information potentially compromised includes the customer’s name, address, credit card number,
credit card expiration date and CVV code. This incident did not compromise the security of your Social Security
number, which we never request you provide to us as part of the purchasing process.
What We Are Doing. We remediated the issue that gave rise to the incident. We retained independent computer
experts to assist in our investigation into what happened and what information is at risk. Our systems have been
reviewed by third party experts to ensure that they are secure.
What You Can Do. Enclosed is helpful information on how to protect against identity theft and fraud. To help
protect your identity, we have engaged Experian®, the largest credit bureau in the US, to offer you complimentary

            ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD
You may also take action directly to further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss. We
encourage you to be vigilant by reviewing your account statements regularly and monitoring your credit reports for
suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major
credit bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228.
You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.
At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a “fraud alert” on your file that alerts creditors to take
additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that because it tells
creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency
verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud
alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or should you have any questions regarding your credit
report, please contact any one of the agencies listed below. Information regarding security freezes is also available
from these agencies.
