                                 Letter From Our President

November 20, 2015

Dear Starwood Customers:

We recently became aware of a malware intrusion that affected some point of sale systems at a
limited number of Starwood hotels in North America. Promptly after discovering the issue, we
engaged third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation. We have been
working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating our efforts with the payment
card organizations to determine the facts. We want to assure you that protecting the security of
our customers’ personal information is a top priority for Starwood.

Based on the investigation, we discovered that the point of sale systems at certain Starwood
hotels were infected with malware, enabling unauthorized parties to access payment card data of
some of our customers. We want you to know that the affected hotels have taken steps to secure
customer payment card information, and the malware no longer presents a threat to customers
using payment cards at our hotels.

We have determined the following:

      The attack targeted certain point of sale systems at a limited number of Starwood
       properties in North America. The locations and potential dates of exposure for each
       affected Starwood property are listed here.

      The malware affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of sale systems at
       the relevant Starwood properties. We have no indication at this time that our guest
       reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership systems were impacted.

      The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including
       cardholder name, payment card number, security code and expiration date. There is no
       evidence that other customer information, such as contact information, Social Security
       numbers or PINs, were affected by this issue.
                                                                          One StarPoint
                                                                     Stamford, CT 06902
                                                                           United States




We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause. We take our obligation to safeguard
personal information very seriously and are alerting affected customers about this incident so
they can take steps to help protect their information. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free
credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order
your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.
We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring
your free credit reports. If you believe your payment card may have been affected, please
contact your bank or card issuer immediately.

In addition, we have arranged with AllClear ID to offer identity protection and credit monitoring
services to affected Starwood customers for one year at no cost to them. The Reference Guide
provides information on registration and recommendations by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission on the protection of personal information.

If you have any questions or would like more information, please call 1-855-270-9179 (U.S. and
Canada) or 1-512-201-2201 (International), Monday through Saturday, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm
CST.

Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this issue may cause.

Sincerely,



Sergio Rivera
President, The Americas
                                                                           One StarPoint

                                                                            United States




                                        Reference Guide

We encourage affected customers to take the following steps:

Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit
Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) website at
www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit
reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
Look in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit.
Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer
reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal
information” section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social
Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting
agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning
sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any
inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the
information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or
charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency
by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you.
If the information can’t be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved.
Information that can’t be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff’s office
because it may signal criminal activity.

Identity Protection and Credit Monitoring Services. Starwood has arranged with AllClear ID
to offer affected customers identity protection, credit monitoring and fraud assistance services
for 12 months at no cost to them. These services start on November 20, 2015, and will be

help them recover financial losses and restore their credit and identity. Affected Starwood

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly
notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity
theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC and your state Attorney
General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take
these steps:

      Place an initial fraud alert.
      Order your credit reports.
      Create an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit by submitting a report about the theft at
       http://www.ftc.gov/complaint or by calling the FTC.
      File a police report about the identity theft and get a copy of the police report or the
       report number. Bring your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit with you when you file the police
       report.
      Your Identity Theft Report is your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit plus your police report.
       You may be able to use your Identity Theft Report to remove fraudulent information
       from your credit report, prevent companies from refurnishing fraudulent information to a
       consumer reporting agency, stop a company from collecting a debt that resulted from
       identity theft, place an extended seven-year fraud alert with consumer reporting
       agencies, and obtain information from companies about accounts the identity thief
       opened or misused.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of
identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible
identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you
against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a
merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice
that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take
steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by
calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated
telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer
reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as
described above.

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security
freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to
prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies
without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze,
which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security
freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information
on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the
FTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state
to state, please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more
information.

The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your
request. For example, you may be asked to provide:

      Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)
      Your Social Security number
      Your date of birth
      Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
      A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s
       license or military ID card)
      Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account
       statement)

For Maryland Residents. You can obtain information from the Maryland Office of the Attorney
General about steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may contact the Maryland
Attorney General at:

Maryland Office of the Attorney General
Consumer Protection Division
200 St. Paul Place
Baltimore, MD 21202
(888) 743-0023 (toll-free in Maryland)
(410) 576-6300
www.oag.state.md.us

For Massachusetts Residents. You have the right to obtain a police report and request a
security freeze as described above. The consumer reporting agencies may charge you a fee of
up to $5 to place a security freeze on your account, and may require that you provide certain
personal information (such as your name, Social Security number, date of birth, and address)
and proper identification (such as a copy of a government-issued ID card and a bill or
statement) prior to honoring your request for a security freeze. There is no charge, however, to
place, lift or remove a security freeze if you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide
the consumer reporting agencies with a valid police report.

General’s Office about preventing identity theft. You can contact the North Carolina Attorney

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                Starwood Notifies Customers of Malware Intrusion

Stamford, Conn. – November 20, 2015 – Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
(NYSE:HOT) announced today that the point of sale systems of a limited number of its
hotels in North America were infected with malware, enabling unauthorized parties to
access payment card data of some customers.

Promptly after discovering the issue, Starwood engaged third-party forensic experts to
conduct an extensive investigation to determine the facts. Based on the investigation,
malware was detected that affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of
sale systems at the relevant Starwood properties. There is no indication at this time
that the Company’s guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership
systems were impacted. The malware was designed to collect certain payment card
information, including cardholder name, payment card number, security code and
expiration date. There is no evidence that other customer information, such as contact
information or PINs, were affected by this issue. The affected hotels have taken steps
to secure customer payment card information and the malware no longer presents a
threat to customers using payment cards at Starwood hotels.

“Protecting our customers’ information is critically important to Starwood and we take
this issue extremely seriously,” said Sergio Rivera, Starwood President, The Americas.
“Quickly after we became aware of the possible issue, we took prompt action to
determine the facts. We have been working closely with law enforcement authorities
and have been coordinating our efforts with the payment card organizations. We want
to assure our customers that we have implemented additional security measures to
help prevent this type of crime from reoccurring.”

Starwood encourages customers to carefully review and monitor their payment card
account statements. If a customer believes his or her payment card may have been
affected, the customer should immediately contact their bank or card issuer.
The locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood property is
available at www.starwoodhotels.com/paymentcardsecuritynotice. Customers with
questions may call 1-855-270-9179 (U.S. and Canada) or 1-512-201-2201
(International), Monday through Saturday, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm CST or visit
