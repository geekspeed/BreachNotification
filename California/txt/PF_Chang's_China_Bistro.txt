Statement From Rick Federico CEO of P.F. Chang's
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Aug. 4, 2014)—On Tuesday, June 10, the United States Secret Service
alerted P.F. Chang's to a possible security compromise involving credit and debit card data
reportedly stolen from certain P.F. Chang’s China Bistro branded restaurants located in the
continental United States. An investigation into this incident was immediately initiated. Our
team, including third-party forensics experts, has been working continuously to understand the
nature and scope of the incident. This investigation is ongoing. The security compromise,
however, has been contained, and P.F. Chang’s has been processing credit and debit card data
securely since June 11, 2014.

We have determined that the security of our card processing systems was compromised, and we
have reason to believe that the intruder may have stolen some data from certain credit and debit
cards that were used during specified time frames at 33 P.F. Chang’s China Bistro branded
restaurant locations in the continental United States. The potentially stolen credit and debit card
data includes the card number and in some cases also the cardholder’s name and/or the card’s
expiration date. However, we have not determined that any specific cardholder’s credit or debit
card data was stolen by the intruder.

Please visit pfchangs.com/security for a list of the 33 restaurant locations from which we believe
credit and debit card data may have been stolen and, for each location, the time frame during
which we believe the possibly compromised cards were used by guests at that location. At that
site guests can also learn more about the identity protection services being provided for all
potentially affected guests. Given the continuing nature of the investigation, other time frames,
locations or findings may be identified; therefore, we encourage you to check the site
periodically for future updates.

P.F. Chang’s encourages its guests to remain vigilant and seek to protect against possible identity
theft or other financial loss by reviewing account statements for any unusual activity, notifying
their credit card companies, and monitoring their credit reports. Under U.S. law, individuals are
entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To obtain a
free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, (877) 322-8228.

At no charge, P.F. Chang’s guests can also have these credit bureaus place a "fraud alert" on
their files that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify their identity prior to granting
credit in their names. Please note, however, that because it tells creditors to follow certain
procedures to protect the individual’s credit, it may also delay the ability to obtain credit while
the agency verifies the individual’s identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms an
individual’s fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on that individual’s file. Any
individual wishing to place a fraud alert, or who has questions regarding their credit report, can
contact any one of the following agencies: Equifax, P.O. Box 105069, Atlanta, GA 30348-5069,
800-525-6285, www.equifax.com; Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, 888-397-3742,
www.experian.com; or TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, 800-680-7289,
www.transunion.com. Information regarding security freezes may also be obtained from these
sources.

has been misused to file a complaint with them. To file a complaint with the FTC, or to obtain

4261. State Attorneys General may also have advice on preventing identity theft, and instances
of known or suspected identity theft should be reported to law enforcement, the Attorney
General in the individual’s state of residence, and the FTC. Individuals can also learn more about
placing a fraud alert or security freeze on their credit files by contacting the FTC or their state's
Attorney General. For North Carolina residents, the Attorney General can be contacted at 9001
