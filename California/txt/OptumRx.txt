Dear Name,

We wanted to make you aware of a recent incident that may have affected some of your health
information. On March 22, 2016, we were notified that an unencrypted laptop computer
belonging to a vendor of OptumRx, which provides home delivery prescription services to you,
was stolen from one of its employee’s vehicles. The theft occurred on March 16, 2016 in
Indianapolis, Indiana.

Working with the vendor, we determined that an electronic file on the stolen laptop included
your name, address, health plan name, prescription drug information and prescribing provider
information. In some cases date of birth was also present. No financial information (Social
Security number, credit card or financial account information) was involved.

Upon discovery of the theft, local law enforcement was immediately notified and an outside
investigation was also launched. In addition, we have worked with the vendor to put immediate
and additional protections in place to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.
These measures include additional security requirements on laptops they use for OptumRx work,
training and reinforcement of existing policies and practices, and further evaluation of additional
safeguards.

We deeply regret this incident and any inconvenience or concern that it may cause. As a
precaution to protect against misuse of your health information, we recommend that you
regularly monitor account statements and the explanation of benefits statements that you receive
from your health plan to check for any unfamiliar health care services or prescription activity. If
you notice any health care services or prescription activity that you did not receive listed on an
explanation of benefits statement, please contact your health plan immediately.

In addition, while no financial information was compromised, we are also offering one year of
LifeLock® identity theft protection services at no cost to you. This service includes proactive
identity theft protection, identity theft alerts, address change verification, annual copies of your
credit report from all three national credit bureaus, and comprehensive recovery services if you
become a victim of identity theft during your LifeLock® membership. We have enclosed
instructions for your convenience in registering for this service.

In addition, you may want to order copies of your credit reports from each of the three national
credit reporting agencies to check for any inaccurate information, particularly medical services
                                                                         OptumRx Privacy Office
                                                                         11000 Optum Circle (MN101)

                                                                         Eden Prairie, MN 55344
