Dear <<First Name>><<Last Name>>,

Lokai understands the importance of protecting your personal information. We are writing this letter to inform you
about an incident which may involve some of your information.

After we were informed of reports of fraudulent charges appearing on payment cards that were legitimately used
on our website, we engaged a leading computer security firm to conduct an investigation. On October 28, 2014 the
investigation found that an unauthorized person gained access to the server that hosts our website and installed
a program that was designed to record information entered by customers. Based on our investigation, we believe
information entered on our website from July 18, 2014 to October 28, 2014 could have been affected.

The information affected by this incident may include your name, address, payment card number, expiration date,
verification code, and the user name and password for your account at mylokai.com. Our records show that you made
a purchase using a payment card ending in <<xxxx>> during this time.

We are notifying you so that you can take appropriate steps to protect yourself. We recommend that you remain
vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your financial statements for any unauthorized
activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution because the major
credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely
reported. We have already reset the password you use for this account. Also, if you use the same user e-mail address
and password for any other account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide
credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call
toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

         Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
         Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
         TransUnion, PO Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834, www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been
misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the attorney generalâ€™s office in your
home state. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as

correct your records.
