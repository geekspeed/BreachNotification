             	      Re:		Notice	of	Security	Incident	
             	
             Dear	[MEMBER	NAME]:	
             The	purpose	of	this	letter	is	to	report	a	security	incident	of	which	SynerMed	has	become	
             aware,	that	involved	the	theft	from	one	of	our	employees	of	a	laptop	computer	containing	
             protected	health	information	(PHI)	of	members	of	Inland	Valleys	IPA	(IVIPA).	
             	
             Security	Incident	
             	
             The	security	incident	occurred	on	the	night	of	April	14	or	early	morning	on	April	15,	2013,	
             when	a	thief	broke	into	an	automobile	belonging	to	an	employee	that	was	parked	in	front	of	
             the	 employee’s	 home.	 	 The	 thief	 stole	 the	 employee’s	 SynerMed	 laptop	 computer,	 which	
             had	member	PHI	on	its	hard	drive.		The	employee	discovered	the	theft	on	the	morning	of	
             April	15	and	immediately	contacted	local	police	and	SynerMed.	
             	
             The	 laptop	 was	 password‐protected,	 and	 any	 ability	 to	 use	 the	 laptop	 to	 connect	 to	
             SynerMed	systems	was	eliminated	immediately	in	the	early	morning,	April	15.			
             		
             Information	Involved	
             	
             The	SynerMed	employee	who	was	the	victim	of	the	crime	confirmed	that	4	reports	were	on	
             the	laptop’s	hard	drive	that	could	have	contained	your	PHI.		The	information	consisted	of	
             member	name,	membership	number,	member	address,	CPT	Code,	Diagnosis	Code,	and	date	
             of	birth	(in	some	cases).	The	PHI	did	not	include	social	security	numbers,	driver's	license	
             numbers,	or	any	other	financial	information.	
             	
             Mitigation	Action	
             	
             As	 previously	 stated,	 the	 laptop	 was	 password‐protected,	 and	 the	 PHI	 contained	 on	 the	
             laptop	 did	 not	 include	 social	 security	 numbers,	 driver's	 license,	 or	 any	 financial	
             information.	 Accordingly,	 the	 probability	 is	 low	 that	 the	 PHI	 can	 be	 used	 in	 a	 manner
