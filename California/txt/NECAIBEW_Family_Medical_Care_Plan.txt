                    Dear FMCP Member:

                    We are contacting you as a precautionary measure because we have learned of a potential data
                    security incident involving your personal information. Recent correspondence sent to you near
                    the end of 2012 containing the NECA/IBEW Family Medical Care Plan’s (FMCP) generic
                    Summary of Benefits Coverage and the Summary of Material Modifications disclosure
                    documents inadvertently included your Social Security number on the envelope. The Social
                    Security number did not contain dashes used in the traditional “xxx-xx-xxxx” Social Security
                    number format, and the contents of the mailing contained no health information in any way
                    specific to you.

                    We sincerely apologize for this error and we wish to assure you that the FMCP is taking all
                    measures necessary to ensure such an incident will never happen again. We are in the process
                    of reviewing all of our systems and vendor relationships to make sure of this and we are already
                    implementing additional internal controls and safeguards.

                    While we believe the potential risk to you in this case is limited, particularly since the Social
                    Security number did not contain dashes which would more clearly identify the number as a
                    Social Security number, we want to provide you with the opportunity to take steps to help
                    protect your personal information, as follows:

                    1.     LifeLock®

                           We have arranged for you, at your option, to enroll in an identity theft protection service
                           with LifeLock® at no cost to you for one year. Please see the attached letter from
                           LifeLock® for instructions on how to enroll.

                    2.     Additional Precautionary Measures

                           Please also review the following for specific information on other measures you can take
                           to protect your information, and how to receive and monitor your credit report for free.

                           •   Review Your Account Information and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious
                               Activity – We recommend that you review your bank, credit card, and other account
                               statements and that you obtain and read your credit reports closely. If you detect
                               any suspicious activity on an account, you should notify the financial institution or
                               company with which the account is maintained. You also should report any
                               suspicious activity relating to identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your
                               state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. To file a complaint
                               with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).

                           •   Obtain Your Credit Report – You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from
                               each of the three major credit reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, and
                               TransUnion) once every 12 months. These three companies have set up a central
                               website, a toll-free telephone number, and a mailing address through which you can

                                   companies using the contact information below. When you contact one of the credit
