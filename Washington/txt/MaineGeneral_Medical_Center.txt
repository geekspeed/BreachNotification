         Re:       Notice of Data Event


Dear Sir/Madam:

Our office represents MaineGeneral Medical Center ("MaineGeneral"), 35 Medical Parkway,
Augusta, Maine 04330. We write to provide you with notice of an event that may impact the
security of personal information relating to seventy seven (77) Washington residents. The
investigation into this event is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new
significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, MaineGeneral does
not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Washington law or personal
jurisdiction.

                                          Nature of the Data Security Incident

On November 13, 2015, MaineGeneral was notified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of
the detection of certain data, believed to belong to MaineGeneral, on an external website, which is
not accessible by the general public. MaineGeneral immediately launched an internal investigation
by its IT team to confirm the security of its systems and source of the data. On November 18, 2015,
MaineGeneral validated the data supplied by the FBI as MaineGeneral data. MaineGeneral hired a
highly respected cyber security forensics firm to supplement its investigation. MaineGeneral
continues to cooperate with the FBI.

MaineGeneral's investigation, the investigation of the third-party forensic consultants, and the
FBI's investigation are ongoing. However, MaineGeneral has determined that it had experienced a
sophisticated cyber-attack and that certain personally identifiable and protected health information
on its network may have been subject to unauthorized access on or about September 11, 2015 and
September 12, 2015, including patient names, Social Security numbers, addresses, medical
information, treatment information, diagnosis information, health insurance information, date of
birth, emergency contact information, guarantor contact information, and employer information;
however, of the data listed above, the data detected by the FBI only included patient dates of birth
and patient emergency contact information. The data detected by the FBI on the external website
does not contain Social Security numbers, patient names, patient medical or health insurance
information, health records, driver's license numbers, or credit/financial account information.

                                 Notice to Washington Residents

MaineGeneral has determined this incident compromised the security of personally identifiable
information relating to seventy seven (77) Washington residents. MaineGeneral is mailing written
notice of this incident to these seventy seven (77) Washington residents on or about January 15,
2016 in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

                              Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

MaineGeneral's investigation, the investigation of the third-party forensic consultants, and the
FBI's investigation are ongoing. MaineGeneral is offering those individuals impacted by this
incident with access to one free year of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, and is
providing these individuals with helpful information on how to better protect against identity theft
and fraud. MaineGeneral has taken steps to prevent additional unauthorized access to its computer
network and continues to monitor its systems for suspicious activity. In addition to providing notice
of this incident to your office, MaineGeneral is conspicuously posting notice of this incident on its
website, providing notice of this incident to other regulators, state-wide media, and consumer
reporting agencies where required.

    Placing a "fraud alert" on your credit file. A "fraud alert" will tell creditors to take additional steps to verify your
    identity prior to granting credit in your name; however, because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to
    protect you, it may also delay your ability to obtain credit while the credit bureaus verify your identity. As soon as
    one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your files. You may use
    the contact information listed above to contact the major credit bureaus and place a "fraud alert" on your credit
    report.

    Placing a "security freeze" on your credit file, that prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any
    information from your credit report without your written authorization but may delay, interfere with, or prevent the
    timely approval of any requests for new credit. If you have been a victim of identity theft, and provide the credit
    reporting agency with a valid police report, the credit reporting agency cannot charge to place, lift or remove a
    security freeze. In all other cases, a credit agency may charge you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently
    remove a security freeze. Maine residents cannot be charged to place, lift or remove a security freeze. You must
    contact each of the credit reporting agencies separately to place a security freeze on your credit file:
