Mr. Ferguson:

On behalf of Advance Auto Parts, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident involving
information relating to Advance Auto Parts employees.

Specifically, on March 7, 2016, a third party obtained unauthorized access to employee
information. This access was through a phishing-type attack in which an outside party posing as
an Advance employee convinced an employee to provide a file containing information about
certain individuals who worked for Advance during 2015. The employee believed the email
request for this file was a legitimate internal data request. Through our investigation, we have
determined that the third party had access to an employee's name and Social Security number,
2015 gross wages and the state(s) in which the employee files income taxes.

We will notify 544 employees who are Washington residents of this incident by mail on March
17, 2016 and, in some instances, by e-mail and in-person briefing on March 16, 2016. Attached
is a sample of that letter. We have also arranged for AllClear ID to provide employees with two-
years of identity protection services (AllClear SECURE and AllClear PRO), at no charge to the
employees.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at (540) 561-1173 if you have any questions.

                                            Sincerely,




                                            Tammy Moss Finley
                                            Executive Vice President,

       Dear John Sample,
                                                   NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

                                                           March 17, 2016

       On behalf of Advance Auto Parts, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that exposed some employee
       information about you. We take the protection of employee information very seriously. This is why we are contacting
       you directly to let you know what occurred and how we are responding to assist you.

       WHAT HAPPENED. On March 7, 2016, a third party obtained unauthorized access to employee information. This
       access was through a phishing-type attack in which an outside party posing as an Advance employee convinced an
       employee to provide a file containing information about certain individuals who worked for Advance during 2015. The
       employee believed the email request for this file was a legitimate internal data request. The information was not
       obtained through a breach of Advance's information systems.

       WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED. The employee information involved included your name, your Social
       Security number, your 2015 gross wages, and the state(s) in which you pay income taxes.

       WHAT WE ARE DOING. We learned of and began investigating the matter on March 7 and quickly determined the
       nature and scope of the incident. We also notified federal law enforcement of this incident, requesting that they
       investigate fully. We are currently communicating to all relevant current and former employees and are offering free
       identity protection services and hotline support. We will continue to assess any additional actions needed to protect
       our employee information.

       WHAT YOU CAN DO. We recommend that you review the information provided in this letter for some steps that you
       may take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your personal information.

       As a precaution, we have engaged AIICIear ID to provide you with the following identity protection services for 24
       months at no cost to you.

                                                                                                       01-03-1-00

         identity theft insurance policy. To use the PRO service, you will need to provide your personal information

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account
statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or
suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") or law enforcement to report incidents of identity
theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the
FTC's Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338), or write to Federal
Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover
information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting
agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free
copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may
obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You
may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Equifax                             Experian                      TransUnion
(800) 525-6285                      (888) 397-3742                (800) 916-8800
P.O. Box 740241                     P.O. Box 9701                 Fraud Victim Assistance Division
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241              Allen, TX 75013               P.O. Box 2000
www.equifax,com                     www.experian.com              Chester, PA 19022
                                                                  www.transunion.com

In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts
and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A
fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain
procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file
by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes
your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition,
you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict
access to your credit report:

         Equifax — (800) 349-9960
         Experian — (888) 397-3742
         TransUnion — (888) 909-8872

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information.
The fee to place a credit freeze varies based on where you live. After receiving your request, each credit reporting
agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need in order to lift or
remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

Additionally, the FTC and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") both generally recommend that individuals who
believe that they may be at risk of taxpayer refund fraud should, in addition to the above-described steps, file their
income taxes as soon as possible. The IRS further suggests that a taxpayer who is an actual or potential victim of
identity theft complete and submit to the IRS Form 14039 (Identity Theft Affidavit). Form 14039 is available at
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fl4039.pdf, Upon receipt of this affidavit, the IRS may flag your taxpayer account to
identify questionable activity.

cause you. We have established a dedicated hotline that you can call if you have questions regarding this incident.
The toll-free hotline number is 1-855-904-5736. You may also go to a dedicated website at aap.allclearid.com to
