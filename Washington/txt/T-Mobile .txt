RE: Notification of Security Breach

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing on behalf of T-Mobile USA, Inc. to inform you of a recent security breach incident
involving data handled on its behalf by Experian.

Based on Experian’s investigation to date, we understand that Experian discovered that an
unauthorized party accessed their systems on September 15, 2015. On September 21, 2015, T-
Mobile USA, Inc. was notified by Experian that information Experian processes and stores on
their behalf, including information consumers provided when they applied for an account with
T-Mobile, likely was acquired. Records containing each consumer’s name, address, social
security number, date of birth, identification number (typically a driver’s license, military ID, or
passport number) and additional information used in T-Mobile's own credit assessment, had
been downloaded by the intruder. No payment card or banking information was obtained. On
September 22, 2015, Experian determined that although social security and identification
numbers were encrypted, that encryption may have been compromised. The data of
approximately 328,889 residents in your state who applied for service from September 1, 2013
through September 16, 2015 may have been accessed by the intruder.

Experian has assured T-Mobile that it continues to investigate the incident and is taking the
necessary steps to prevent it from recurring. Experian is mailing notification letters to affected
individuals beginning next week. Please find enclosed a copy of the notification letter. In
addition to notifying impacted individuals with written notice, Experian is notifying impacted
individuals through a public website and notices in statewide media.

Please contact me with any questions or concerns regarding this incident.

Sincerely,




Amelia M. Gerlicher

I	am	writing	to	let	you	know	of	an	incident	that	occurred	involving	T‐Mobile	USA	data

passport	number)	and	additional	information	used	in	T‐Mobile's	own	credit	assessment.	
No	payment	card	or	banking	information	was	obtained.	This	did	not	involve	access	to	
Experian’s	credit	reporting	database.	
Experian	has	notified	appropriate	federal,	state	and	international	law	enforcement	
agencies	and	has	taken	additional	security	steps	to	help	prevent	future	incidents.

What	You	Can	Do	to	Protect	Yourself		
There	are	additional	steps	you	can	take	to	protect	yourself	from	fraudulent	activity	and	
identity	theft:	
Monitor	your	credit	reports	for	fraudulent	transactions	or	accounts		
       Obtain	a	free	copy	of	your	credit	report	maintained	by	each	of	the	three	credit	
        reporting	agencies	by	visiting	www.annualcreditreport.com	or	by	calling	toll‐free	
        877‐322‐8228.	
       Review	your	reports	carefully.	If	you	find	anything	you	do	not	understand	or	that	is	
        incorrect,	contact	the	appropriate	credit	reporting	agency.		
       If	you	suspect	fraudulent	activity,	contact	your	local	law	enforcement	agency,	the	
        attorney	general	of	your	state,	and	the	Federal	Trade	Commission.		
Consider	contacting	the	credit	reporting	agencies	directly	to	activate	a	fraud	alert	or	
a	security	freeze		
       A	fraud	alert	will	notify	any	merchant	checking	your	credit	history	that	you	may	be	
        the	victim	of	identity	theft	and	that	the	merchant	should	take	additional	measures	to	
        verify	the	application.	Notifying	any	of	the	three	credit	reporting	agencies	will	place	
        an	alert	on	your	file	across	all	three.		
       A	security	freeze	restricts	all	creditor	access	to	your	account,	but	might	also	delay	
        any	requests	you	make	for	new	accounts.	Inquire	with	the	credit	reporting	agencies	
        for	their	specific	procedures	regarding	security	freezes.
