        Re:     Brunswick Hotel & Tavern         -   Notice of Data Security Incident Affecting 30 Washington
                Residents

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

Olympia Hotel Management, LLC ("Olympia," "we", "us"), manager of the Brunswick Hotel & Tavern
located at 4 Noble Street, Brunswick, Maine, is writing to notify you of a data security incident that we
believe may have compromised the security of 30 Washington residents' personal information. Based
on information made available to us on August 12, 2015, it appears that keylogging malware was placed
on the Brunswick Hotel's computer network by unknown individuals and may have resulted in
unauthorized access to the personal information of certain guests at the Brunswick Hotel. Below we
have provided a more detailed account of the pertinent facts that are known to us at this time.

                                         Nature of the Data Security Incident

In late June, we received an inquiry from a group of three guests about fraudulent credit card charges
that occurred after their stay at the Brunswick Hotel. We promptly requested an on-site visit from our
network services vendor, but that vendor's scan of our systems did not reveal any malware. After
receiving two additional inquiries in July, we elected to review our systems again using a different
resource. This second review did reveal evidence of malware, and we promptly performed malware
removal scans, thereby ending the immediate threat. Shortly thereafter, we also retained third-party
computer forensic experts Verizon Business Network Services, Inc. ("Verizon"), a leading cybersecurity
and investigations company, to help us further examine the nature of the detected malware and identify
what information on the Brunswick Hotel's network, if any, may have been exposed as a result of the
malware. In addition, we retained privacy and data security legal counsel to assist in the ongoing
investigation of, and response to, the incident.

Based on Verizon's thorough forensic investigation of our systems, it appears that one of the front desk
computers at the Brunswick Hotel was infected with sophisticated malware, known as AlienSpy,
designed to capture and exfiltrate payment card information that was typed or swiped into that system
while avoiding detection by anti-virus software. Based on forensic investigation results, Verizon has
determined that the malware may have been active on or between November 29, 2014 and July 21,
2015 (the "Affected Period") and that the keylogging function of the malware detected guest names and
payment card information. To date, Verizon has not found any conclusive evidence that this
information was exfiltrated from the system but also cannot conclusively confirm that no information
was exfiltrated. As a result, we are taking the conservative view that all guests at the Brunswick Hotel




                            TH
   7 CUSTOM HOUSE STREET,   5    FLOOR                P0 Box 508                 PORTLAND, MAINE 04112-0508
Page 2



whose name and payment card information was typed or swiped into the infected front desk terminal
during the Affected Period may be at risk and are notifying such guests accordingly.

                                    Notice to Washington Residents

As stated above, we are notifying all guests whose name and payment card information was typed or
swiped into the infected front desk terminal during the Affected Period, including 30 Washington
residents. These state residents will be sent written notice of the data security incident on or around
August 28, 2015 in substantially the same form as the sample notice attached to this letter as Exhibit A.

Please note that we do not yet have complete contact information for a small number of guests who
reserved through third party sources. We are working diligently to obtain this information, and, if we
determine that additional Washington residents are among this group, we will send out subsequent
letters. However, to avoid delay we are taking action now with respect to those residents for whom we
already have contact information.

                                    Other Steps Taken/To Be Taken

In addition to providing written notification to potentially affected individuals as described above, we
will offer each of those individuals one year of credit monitoring through Experian, at no cost to those
individuals. We continue to work with independent, third-party computer forensic experts and privacy
and data security legal counsel to help us further evaluate the situation and to take appropriate action.
We have also notified and are working with our payment card vendors to limit the risk to customers of
fraudulent card charges, and will be sending written notice to the major credit reporting agencies.
Finally, we are providing notice of this data security incident to regulators in other states whose
residents may be affected.

                                          Contact Information

Should you have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security incident,
please contact our privacy and data security legal counsel, Peter Guffin (207-791-1199 /
pguffin@pierceatwood.com ) or Kyle Glover ( 207-791-1289 / kglover@pierceatwood.com ), of the law
firm of Pierce Atwood LLP, located at 254 Commercial Street, Portland, ME 04101.
