                What Happened

                        Recently, an examination by our computer security consultant revealed that someone
                without authorization accessed and likely stole credit card information belonging to our
                customers from our website. The thief or thieves accessed our website remotely and
                overcame our firewall and security protections. In your State we have identified @ 593 credit
                cards that are suspected to have been compromised.
                        The compromise event began on September 25, 2015 and involved persons capturing
                keystrokes as customers typed information onto BaileysOnline.com. The suspicious activity
                was first discovered by Kount, who Bailey's uses for credit card fraud protection. They
                started seeing cards used on our site begin turning up for fraud transactions in late December
                of 2015. The breach event was confirmed on January 11, 2016 and stopped on January 13,
                 2016.
                         It was an ASPXSPY intrusion introduced through a known defect in Windows 2008
                 Operating Systems. The theft involved @15,000 credit cards used to pay for purchases on our
                 website during the above time frame. Of these @15,000 cards, nearly 25% were
                 MasterCardO cards, 64% were VISAO cards, and fewer than 5% and 6% were American
                 Expresso and DiscoverO cards, respectively. 95% of the credit cards are from the United
                 States and the balance to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a couple other countries.

                 What Information Was Involved

                          The types of information taken appears to include credit card numbers, cardholder
                 names, address and phone numbers, CCV numbers, card expiration date, your log-in and
                 password to BaileysOnline.com and any other information typed into our website related to
                 your order. However, the following information is NOT included in what was taken: PINS
                 (personal identification numbers), Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, telephone
                 numbers, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information.
                 Bailey's currently holds credit card information temporarily in storage encrypted with the
                 latest (as of February 2015) 256 bit encryption. The thieves did not have access to the
                 encryption key.
                          Bailey's does not collect, store or have customers enter Social Security nun
                 Di7ver's License numbers or state identification/passport information.

 IF         What You Can Do

                    We strongly encourage you to take preventive measures now to help prevent and
            detect any misuse of your information. We suggest that you change your log-in and password
            for BaileysOnline.com. You may also want to cancel the credit card(s), if any, that you think
            you may have used here. You may also want to place a fraud alert or order a security freeze
            on your credit reports with the three major credit reporting agencies: (1) Equifax: 1-800-525-
            6285; www.equifax.com; P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; (2) Experian: 1-888-
            EXPERIAN (397-3742); www.experian.com; P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; and (3)
            TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O.
            Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790. You may want to ask for a free copy of your credit
            report from each agency, and ask that only the last four digits of your Social Security number
            appear on your credit reports.
                    There are several things that you may want to do to protect yourself against possible
            identity theft if the information does get into the wrong hands. These include: (1) watch for
            phishing attempts and malicious email; (2) watch for scam U.S. mail; and (3) stay alert to
            signs of identity theft.
                    The Federal Trade Commission has published some information about how to defend
            against identity theft at:
            http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/defend.html. We suggest that you
            submit a complaint with the FTC by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338) or going
            online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/.

                                NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Hannened

Recently, an examination by our computer security consultant revealed that someone without
authorization accessed and likely stole credit card information belonging to our customers from
our website. The thief or thieves accessed our website remotely and overcame our firewall and
security protections. If you are receiving this letter, then we have identified you as one of the
people who placed an order within the affected date range, identified below, and may have had
certain protected information misappropriated.

The compromise event began on September 25, 2015 and involved persons capturing keystrokes
as customers typed information onto BaileysOnline.com. The breach event was found and
confirmed on January 11, 2016 and stopped on January 13, 2016. It was an exploitation event
introduced through a known defect in Windows 2008 Security. The theft involved @15,000
credit cards used to pay for purchases on our website during the above time frame. Of these
@15,000 cards, nearly 25% were MasterCard@ cards, 64% were VISAS cards, and fewer than
5% and 6% were American Expresso and Discover@ cards, respectively.

What Information Was Involved

The types of information taken appears to include credit card numbers, cardholder names,
address and phone numbers, eMail addresses, CCV numbers, card expiration date, your log-in
and password to BaileysOnline.com and any other information typed into our website related to
your order. However, the following information is NOT included in what was taken: PINs
(personal identification numbers), Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and other
personally identifiable information.

What We Are Doing

We have reported the theft to various law enforcement agencies, and are cooperating with them
in their investigation. We also have notified Wells Fargo Bank, who handles our credit card
transactions, along with MasterCard@, VISAS, American ExpressO and DiscoverS. We have
no indication that any PayPal accounts were impacted.

We also have engaged a security consultant and have been implementing their recommendations
to strengthen our firewall and other security protections (described below). We also have
retained one of the 11 Forensic Web Security firms approved by Wells Fargo to address this data
breach.

In some states we are required to notify a state agency or Attorney General's Office, and
Bailey's is complying with all of those legal requirements.
               What You Can Do

               We strongly encourage you to take preventive measures now to help prevent and detect any
               misuse of your information. We suggest that you change your log-in and password for
               BaileysOnline.com. You may also want to cancel the credit card(s), if any, that you think you
               may have used here. You may also want to place a fraud alert or order a security freeze on your
               credit reports with the three major credit reporting agencies: (1) Equifax: 1-800-525-6285;
               www.equifax.com; P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; (2) Experian: 1-888-
               EXPERIAN (397-3742); www.experian.com; P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; and (3)
               TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O.
               Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790. You may want to ask for a free copy of your credit report
               from each agency, and ask that only the last four digits of your Social Security number appear on
               your credit reports.

               There are several things that you may want to do to protect yourself against possible identity
               theft if the information does get into the wrong hands. These include: (1) watch for phishing
               attempts and malicious email; (2) watch for scam U.S. mail; and (3) stay alert to signs of identity
               theft.

               The Federal Trade Commission has published some information about how to defend against
               identity theft at: http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/defend.html. We
               suggest that you submit a complaint with the FTC by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-
               4338) or going online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/.
