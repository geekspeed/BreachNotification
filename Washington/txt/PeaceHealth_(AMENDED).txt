      Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

       On behalf of our client, PeaceHeatlh, we submit this supplemental notice
regarding a data security incident that involved potential access to patient information
by a former employee of PeaceHealth. As reported to your office on November 30,
2015, PeaceHealth first learned on October 9 that an employee who no longer works at
PeaceHealth accessed patient information in separate instances from a home computer
using third-party websites, including insurance verification websites and prior
authorization portals beginning on June 15, 2015. We immediately began working to
remove access which was accomplished on October 12, 2015. PeaceHealth reported
the unauthorized access to law enforcement and immediately began an investigation.
Law enforcement advised us on December 3, 2015, that additional persons
were potentially affected by this incident and that the information the former
employee accessed included patients’ names, dates of birth, addresses, telephone
numbers, gender, insurance information, and in some instances diagnoses, medications
and social security numbers.

      PeaceHealth engaged the website and portal companies as well as law
enforcement in its investigation but there is no indication that the former employee
accessed the information for identity theft purposes. PeaceHealth has established a
dedicated call center to assist patients with any questions they may have. To help
prevent this from happening in the future, PeaceHealth has received assurances from

the website and portal companies that the former employee no longer has access to
their systems. PeaceHealth is also enhancing the processes that will ensure removal of
access to third-party companies when an employee leaves PeaceHealth.

      PeaceHealth timely notified an additional 812 Washington residents in
substantially the same form as the letters attached hereto on today, December 14,
2015.

       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this
matter.


Sincerely,



Lynn Sessions
