         Re:       Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir/Madame:

We represent SterlingBackcheck, 1 State Street Plaza, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10004.
SterlingBackcheck provides background screening services to clients throughout the world, including to
clients that request screening services be conducted on certain Washington residents. We are providing
notice to your office of an event that may impact the security of personal information relating to one
thousand four hundred and nineteen (1,419) Washington residents for whom SterlingBackcheck performed a
screening service at the request or direction of a SterlingBackcheck client. The investigation into this event
is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its
submission. By providing this notice, SterlingBackcheck does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the
applicability of Washington law or personal jurisdiction.

                                                             Background

SterlingBackcheck provides background screening services to clients located in, among other geographic
areas, the United States, seeking background information relating to job applicants, volunteers, or
professional affiliates ("candidates"). During provision of these services, SterlingBackcheck receives
personally identifiable information of candidates, either directly from the candidates themselves or from the
SterlingBackcheck clients to which the candidate is affiliated.

On May 29, 2015, a laptop used by a SterlingBackcheck employee was stolen from the employee's vehicle.
SterlingBackcheck learned of the incident on May 30, 2015, notified law enforcement, and launched an
investigation to determine the types of information that may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the
theft and to whom this information relates.

While SterlingBackcheck's investigation into this event is ongoing, it has determined an Excel file
containing the names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth of certain candidates may have been stored

                                      Notice to Washington Residents

The names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth of one thousand four hundred and nineteen (1,419)
Washington residents may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. On or about the week of
July 27, 2015, SterlingBackcheck provided notice of this event to its potentially impacted clients. Unless
directed by the client to refrain from doing so, SterlingBackcheck began mailing written notice of this
incident to these one thousand four hundred and nineteen (1,419) potentially impacted Washington residents
on or about August 5, 2015, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

                                   Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

SterlingBackcheck' s investigation into this incident is ongoing. SterlingBackcheck is offering those
individuals impacted by this incident and to whom it is legally obligated or permitted to notify, with access to
two free years of credit monitoring and identity restoration services with AllClear ID and is providing these
individuals with helpful information on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud.
SterlingBackcheck is taking steps to mitigate the risk that an event like this happens again by, among other
things, reviewing data security, privacy, technology, and asset inventory procedures, retraining its employees
on data security and privacy protocols, and installing encryption and remote deletion software on mobile
devices. In addition to providing notice of this incident to your office, SterlingBackcheck is providing
notice of this incident to other regulators and consumer reporting agencies where required.

       Dear John Sample,

       SterlingBackcheck provides background screening services to clients throughout the world, including to a
       client with which you recently applied for employment. As part of your application process, we received
       personal information relating to you, including your name, Social Security number, and date of birth. We
       recently discovered an incident that may affect the security of this personal information. While we are
       unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information, we are writing to provide you with
       information regarding the incident, steps we've taken since discovering the incident, and information on
       what you can do to better protect against identity theft and fraud should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

       What Happened? On May 29, 2015, a password-protected laptop was stolen from a SterlingBackcheck
       employee's vehicle. The employee reported the theft to our office, and we launched an investigation to
       determine what information may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. While our
       investigation is ongoing, we've determined a file containing your name, Social Security number, and date
       of birth may have been stored on the laptop at the time of the theft. We are unaware of any actual or
       attempted misuse of this information, and there is no indication the data that may have been stored
       on the laptop was the target of the theft.

        What is SterlingBackcheck Doing? We take the security of your personal information seriously. In
        addition to launching the ongoing investigation into this incident, we have implemented additional
        measures to mitigate against the risk that an incident like this will happen again by updating our
        encryption and audit procedures, revising our equipment custody protocols, retraining employees on
        privacy and data security, and installing remote-wipe software on portable devices.

        In addition to the steps above, we've provided notice of this incident to our potentially impacted clients
        and are coordinating with these clients to disclose this incident to its potentially impacted candidates and
        provide potentially impacted candidates with complimentary access to 24 months of free credit
        monitoring and identity restoration services with AliClear ID. The enclosed Privacy Safeguards
        Information contains instructions on how to enroll and receive these complimentary services, as well as
        additional information that can be used to better protect against identity theft and fraud. We are also
        providing notice of this incident to certain state regulators and consumer reporting agencies, as required.

        What Can You Do? You can review the enclosed Privacy Safeguards Information. You can also enroll
        to receive the complimentary access to 24 free months of credit monitoring and identity restoration
        services. You can also contact the confidential inquiry line we've established relating to this incident.
        This confidential inquiry line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable




                                                                                               01-02-3-00
                             PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS INFORMATION

To help detect the possible misuse of your information, we have arranged to have AliClear ID protect
your identity for 24 months at no cost to you. The following identity protection services start on the date
of this notice and you can use them at any time during the next 24 months.

AliClear SECURE: The team at AlIClear ID is ready and standing by if you need identity repair
assistance. This service is automatically available to you with no enrollment required. If a problem arises,
simply call 1-855-227-9823 and a dedicated investigator will do the work to recover financial losses,
restore your credit and make sure your identity is returned to its proper condition.

AliClear PRO: This service offers additional layers of protection including credit monitoring and a $1
million identity theft insurance policy. To use the PRO service, you will need to provide your personal
information to AllClear ID. You may sign up online at enroll.allclearid.com or by phone by calling
1-855-227-9823 using the following redemption code: Redemption Code.

Please note: Additional steps may be required by you in order to activate your phone alerts.

You may also take action directly to further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss.
We encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account
statements regularly and monitoring your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S law you are
entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order
your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may
also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

At no charge, you can also have these credit bureaus place a "fraud alert" on your file that alerts creditors
to take additional steps to verify your identity prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that
because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, it may also delay your ability to
obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud
alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, or
should you have any question regarding your credit report, please contact any one of the agencies listed
below:

            Equifax                             Experian                           TransUnion

You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit bureau
from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without the consumer's written
authorization. However, please be advised that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay,
interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages,
employment, housing, or other services.

If you have been a victim of identity theft, and you provide the credit bureau with a valid police report, it
cannot charge you to place, list or remove a security freeze. In all other cases, a credit bureau may charge
you a fee to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. You will need to place a
security freeze separately with each of the three major credit bureaus listed above if you wish to place a
freeze on all of your credit files.




                                                                                        02-02-3
