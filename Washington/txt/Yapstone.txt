         Re:       Notification of Data Security Breach Incident

Dear Sir:

This letter is being sent in accordance with Washington law to inform your office that our
client, Yapstone, Inc. suffered an incident in which certain personal information about
approximately 5264 Washington residents may have been accessible by unauthorized
persons via a Yapstone URL vulnerability. The information potentially exposed included a
combination of name, driver’s license number, bank account number and/or Social Security
Number. Immediately upon the Company’s discovery of this incident on August 4, 2015
Yapstone immediately blocked unauthorized access to the URL and retained outside
experts to investigate the incident, to understand the level of impact, and to remediate any
security vulnerability. While the Company had no information to indicate that Washington
residents’ information has been or will be misused, it provided notification and 24 months
of credit monitoring services to affected individuals. We have enclosed a copy of the
notice letter that was sent to potentially affected individuals on 9/11/2015.

We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notification to your offices. Through
an oversight the recent amendment in the Washington statute was missed. We want to
assure you that all impacted Washington residents were given timely notice of the incident.
Should you have any additional questions, you may contact me directly at 213-488-7362.

Very truly yours,




Catherine D. Meyer

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft including by regularly reviewing your account
statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or
suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may
contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law enforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about
steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTCs Web site, at
www.consumer.gov/idtheft, call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission,
Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. In addition, under U.S. law, you
are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer-reporting agencies. You may
order one, two, or all three reports at the same time, or you may stagger your requests during a 12-month period to keep
an eye on the accuracy and completeness of the information in your reports. To order your free credit reports, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies
at:

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your
credit reports periodically. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them
quickly.
In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts
and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A
fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. Call any
one of the three major credit bureaus listed above to place a fraud alert on your credit file. As soon as one credit bureau
confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit
reporting agencies regarding if and how you may place a security freeze on your credit report to prohibit a credit
reporting agency from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written authorization.
YapStone takes the security of your personal information very seriously, and sincerely regrets that this incident may
affect you. We apologize for this error. YapStone has set up a confidential inquiry line to answer any further questions
you may have. It is available Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. E.D.T. at (877) 238-3816. Please use

IF YOU ARE A WEST VIRGINIA RESIDENT:              You have the right to obtain a security freeze. You may obtain a security freeze on
your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right
to place a security freeze on your credit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer-reporting
agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.
The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When
you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five business days you will be provided a unique personal identification
number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the distribution of your
credit report for a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer-reporting
agency and provide all of the following: (1) The unique personal identification number or password provided by the
consumer-reporting agency; (2) Proper identification to verify your identity; and (3) The period of time for which the report shall be        0123456

available to users of the credit report.
A consumer-reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report shall comply with
the request no later than three business days after receiving the request. A security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you
have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for
certain types of account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities. If you are actively seeking credit, you should understand
that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a
freeze, either completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, a few days before actually applying for new
credit. You have the right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action
can be brought against a consumer-reporting agency.
                                                                                                                                          B2945-L04

Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. E.D.T.
Q6:       What is YapStone doing to protect my information?
A6:       Upon discovery, YapStone immediately blocked unauthorized access to the URL and immediately began an investigation to
identify and remediate any security vulnerability. YapStone sincerely regrets any inconvenience this may cause, and YapStone is
working with a team of third-party forensics experts to investigate and enhance data security and protection. The forensic investigation
to date has indicated that unauthorized access to the exposed information occurred between approximately July 15, 2014 and August 5,
2015.
Despite this unauthorized access, YapStone has no evidence that any of the exposed information has been misused.
YapStone is continuing to take steps to remediate and enhance the security of its systems. Remedial efforts include increasing the security
protections of the YapStone site, enhancing and strengthening YapStones internal password rules, and storage mechanisms, and
increased active monitoring of the affected systems.

your credit file. That bureau will notify the other two bureaus and will send you confirmation that the alert has been placed along with
a free copy of your credit report. Review your credit report carefully to see if there has been any new credit requested. You may
contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring
free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to
report it immediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law
enforcement to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft.
To learn more, you can go to the FTCs Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write
to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. In addition,
under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer-reporting agencies. You
may order one, two, or all three reports at the same time, or you may stagger your requests during a 12-month period to keep an eye
on the accuracy and completeness of the information in your reports. To order your free credit reports, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may also contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies noted
above.
Mark your calendar to review all this information again every three months. Sometimes identity thieves will wait for time to pass
before using your information.
Q10: How will I know if my information was used by someone else to open a fraudulent account or gain unauthorized
access to my accounts?
A10: The best way to find out is to get a copy of your credit report from one of the three credit reporting bureaus. The credit
report will show if there has been any new credit requested using your information. You can get a copy of your credit report from
www.annualcreditreport.com.
You should also check your account statements carefully. If someone else has used your bank account number the activity will appear
on your statement. If you see activity that you did not authorize, call your bank at the number on the back of your statement
immediately and tell them that the activity was not authorized and ask the bank to change your account number.
Q11: How do I put a Fraud Alert on my credit report?
A11: U.S. law allows you to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This is a free service. A 90-day Initial Fraud Alert puts a
statement on your credit file that you may have been or are about to become the victim of identity theft or other fraud. If you specify a
telephone number, anyone using your credit report must call that number or take reasonable steps to verify your identity to confirm
that a credit application is not the result of identity theft.
After you put a fraud alert on your credit report, you will be asked to provide proof of your identification when you apply for credit.
This may limit your ability to apply for instant credit for in-store purchases but it should not interfere with your daily use of existing
credit cards or banking accounts.
You can put a 90-day Initial Alert on your credit report by contacting one of the three major credit bureaus. The one you contact will       0123456
notify the others. This will entitle you to a free credit report. You will receive confirmation of the alert from the bureau you contact.
At the end of the 90-day period you may place an additional Initial Fraud Alert on your credit file. YapStone suggests that you do this
every 90 days for at least one year.
Q12: How can I get in touch with the credit bureaus?
A12: There are three major credit bureaus. They are:
                  Equifax                              Experian                          TransUnion Corp
                  800-525-6285                         888-397-3742                      800-680-7289
                  P.O. Box 740241                      P.O. Box 9532                     Fraud Victim Assistance
                  Atlanta, GA 30374-0241               Allen, TX 75013                   P.O. Box 6790                                   B2945-L04
                  www.equifax.com                      www.experian.com                  Fullerton, CA 92834-6790
                                                                                         www.transunion.com
Q13: Do I have to pay for a credit report?
A13: YapStone has arranged for you to receive two years of credit protection services from Experian at no cost to you through
Experians® ProtectMyID® Alert service which includes: 24 months of credit monitoring services, insurance reimbursement policy and
educational materials and access to expert fraud resolution representatives. To enroll in this service, please refer to the instructions and
personal Activation Code provided in the letter sent to you by YapStone.
You are also entitled to one free credit report a year from each of the three credit reporting bureaus. This means that you can receive one
today from one (e.g. Experian), you can receive another in four months (e.g. from Equifax), and you can receive another in eight months
(e.g. from TransUnion). By spacing out your requests for your free credit report you can monitor your credit over the course of a year. If
you want to receive more than one credit report form any of the credit reporting bureaus during the same year, you may have to pay a small
charge.
Q14: How long will it take to get my credit report?
A14: You can access your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com. You can download or print the report from that site.
You may also request the report by telephone (by calling 1-877-322-8228 and answering some questions to verify who you are) or by mail
(by downloading the request form from www.annualcreditreport.com and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box
105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281). If you request your report by phone or by mail it will take approximately two weeks to process the
request, so you should allow two to three weeks for delivery to you.
Q15: Is there a long-term fraud alert?
A15: A fraud alert is a message added to your credit report that tells anyone who pulls a copy of your credit report that there is possible
fraud associated with your account. It gives them a telephone number to call you before issuing any new credit.
A 90-day Initial Fraud Alert expires after 90 days. If you have been the victim of identity theft you may be able to place a 7-year fraud
alert on your account. You can obtain more information online at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/index.html.
Q16: How long does a fraud alert last?
A16: The Initial Fraud Alert lasts 90 days after it is placed on your report. You can remove the alert by calling the credit bureaus before
the 90 days expires. You can place an initial alert every 90 days by calling one of the credit bureaus. If you are eligible for a long-term
fraud alert, it will last for 7 years.
Q17: Will a fraud alert stop me from using my credit cards?
A17: No. However, a fraud alert may interfere with your ability to get immediate credit, for instance, if you apply for instant credit at a
department store. This is because the department store credit office will have to call you to verify your identity before issuing you credit.
Q18: Can I still apply for credit if I put a fraud alert on my credit report?
A18: Yes. The fraud alert may slow down the process of getting approval for credit because the fraud alert will require that the creditor
verify your identity before approving new credit.
Q19: What should I watch out for on my credit report?
A19: Look for any accounts that you dont recognize especially new accounts. Look in the personal information section to see if the
residence and employment information is correct or has changed.
These things could be indications of fraud. If you see information you do not understand or that is wrong, call the credit bureau at the
number on the report and speak to a staff member. If the information cannot be explained, contact your local police or sheriffs office.
Q20: If someone has used my information, what should I do?
A20: You should immediately notify your local police or sheriffs office and file a report. Get a copy of the police report, because you
may need to give a copy to the credit bureaus or creditors. Also contact one of the three credit bureaus and place a fraud alert on your
account. For more information you can visit the website: www.consumer.gov/idtheft
Q21: Do I need to call all three credit bureaus?
A21: No. When you call one bureau, it will pass the report on to the other two. You should receive a confirming letter from each of the
three bureaus. If you do not receive confirmations from all three credit bureaus, call the bureau that did not confirm the alert.
Q22: Will YapStone contact me to ask for my personal information because of this event?
A22: No. YapStone will not contact you unless you call or write to YapStone first. YapStone will not ask for bank account information
or personal identification numbers (PINs) or for your full credit card or social security number. If you are contacted directly by someone
who claims to be with YapStone and who asks you for your personal information, please immediately contact YapStone as well as your
local sheriffs office to report the suspicious contact.

                                                                                                                                       B2945-L04
Q23: I have been contacted directly by someone claiming to be from YapStone or a law enforcement agency asking for my
personal information (e.g., social security number, etc.). Did you contact me? What should I do?
A23: No. YapStone did not contact you unless you called or wrote YapStone first. YapStone will never contact you asking for bank
account information or personal identification numbers (PINs) or for your full credit card or social security number. If you were
contacted directly by someone who claimed to be with YapStone or law enforcement and who asks you for your personal information,
please immediately contact us as well as your local sheriffs office to report the suspicious contact. You may also provide YapStone
with your name and telephone number and YapStone will have the appropriate authorities contact you directly. When law
enforcement contacts you, they will reference your contact with YapStone.
Q24: Will you contact me by email to sign up for credit monitoring/identity protection services?
A24: No. You should be aware of scam email campaigns targeting individuals of a recent data breech. These scams, designed to
capture personal information (known as phishing), appear as if they are from YapStone and include a click here link for credit
monitoring. These emails are NOT from YapStone. Do not reply to the email or reach out to the senders in any way. Do not supply
any information on the website that may open, if you have clicked on a link in email. Do not open any attachments that arrive with
email.
YapStone is not calling individuals regarding the security incident and are not asking for credit card information or Social Security
numbers over the phone or via email. For more guidance on recognizing scam email, please visit the FTC Website:
