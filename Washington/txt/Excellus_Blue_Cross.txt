RE: Excellus Blue Cross Data Breach

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

We write to inform you that Excellus Blue Cross ("Excellus") is a downstream subcontractor to one
of our self-funded group health plans ("Plan"). Our Plan is administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield
of Massachusetts ("BCBSMA"), and not by Excellus. However, we understand from BCBSMA that
Excellus plays a role in processing claims for our Plan participants who have received medical care
and service in certain circumstances, such as when a participant receives medical care in an Excellus
state.

As you are aware, Excellus was the victim of a cyber-attack, commencing on or about August 5, 2015
("Incident'). We were first informed of the Incident by our insurance broker on September 9, 2015,
but there was no information whether and to what extent any of our Plan participants were impacted.
We have been in communication with BCBSMA representatives, who since informed us on October
19, 2015, that 86 members of our Plan were impacted, 1 of who reside in your state.

Excellus states the personal information accessed in the Excellus data breach included: name, date of
birth, gender, health plan member ID, address, phone number, email, address, social security number,
bank account information and claims information. We are not aware of any fraud that has occurred as
a result of this incident, but Excellus is offering two years of credit monitoring to affected individuals.

Excellus has previously sent notices to each impacted Plan participant. In the meantime, we have
emailed our participants with the attached notification more generally on October 19, 2015, to alert
them to this issue in advance of the communication from BCBSMA.

If you have any questions for us, please contact me.

  ncerely,
