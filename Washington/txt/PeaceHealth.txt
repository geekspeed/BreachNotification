      Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

       On behalf of our client, PeaceHeatlh, we submit this notice regarding a data
security incident that involved potential access to patient information by a former
employee of PeaceHealth. On October 9, 2015, PeaceHealth first learned that an
employee who no longer works at PeaceHealth accessed patient information in
separate instances from a home computer using third-party websites, including
insurance verification websites and prior authorization portals beginning on June 15,
2015. We immediately began working to remove access which was accomplished on
October 12, 2015. PeaceHealth reported the unauthorized access to law enforcement
and immediately began an investigation. The investigation determined that the
information the former employee accessed included patients’ names, dates of birth,
addresses, telephone numbers, gender, insurance information, and in some instances
diagnoses, medications and social security numbers.

       PeaceHealth continues to work with law enforcement in its investigation but there
is no indication that the former employee accessed the information for identity theft
purposes. PeaceHealth has established a dedicated call center to assist patients with
any questions they may have. To help prevent this from happening in the future,
PeaceHealth has received assurances from the website and portal companies that the
former employee no longer has access to their systems. PeaceHealth is also

enhancing the processes that will ensure removal of access to third-party companies
when an employee leaves PeaceHealth.

      PeaceHealth timely notified 593 Washington residents in substantially the same
form as the letters attached hereto on November 23, 2015.

       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this
matter.


Sincerely,



Lynn Sessions
