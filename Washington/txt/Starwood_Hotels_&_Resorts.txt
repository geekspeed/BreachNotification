To Whom It May Concern:

In accordance with R.C.W. 19.255.010, I am writing to notify you regarding the nature and
circumstances of a recent data security incident.

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”) recently learned that a maiware
intrusion affected some point of sale systems at a limited number of Starwood hotels in North
America.

Promptly after discovering the issue, Starwood engaged third-party forensic experts to
conduct an extensive investigation. Based on the investigation, the company discovered
evidence indicating that the point of sale systems at certain Starwood hotels were infected
with maiware, enabling unauthorized parties to access payment card data of some of its
customers. The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including
cardholder name, payment card number, security code and expiration date. Attached is a list
of locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood property. There is no
evidence that other customer information, such as contact information, Social Security
numbers or PINs, were affected by this issue. The malware affected certain restaurants, gift
shops and other point of sale systems at the relevant Starwood properties. Starwood has no
indication at this time that its guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership
systems were impacted.

The affected hotels have taken steps to secure customer payment card information, and the
malware no longer presents a threat to customers using payment cards at the hotels. Starwood
is offering identity protection and credit monitoring services to affected Starwood customers
for one year at no cost to them.

                                  Letter From Our President

 November 20, 2015

 Dear Starwood Customers:

 We recently became aware of a maiware intrusion that affected some point of sale systems at a
 limited number of Starwood hotels in North America. Promptly after discovering the issue, we
 engaged third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation. We have been
 working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating our efforts with the payment
 card organizations to determine the facts. We want to assure you that protecting the security of
 our customers’ personal information is a top priority for Starwood.

 Based on the investigation, we discovered that the point of sale systems at certain Starwood
 hotels were infected with malware, enabling unauthorized parties to access payment card data of
 some of our customers. We want you to know that the affected hotels have taken steps to secure
 customer payment card information, and the malware no longer presents a threat to customers
 using payment cards at our hotels.

 We have determined the following:

    •   The attack targeted certain point of sale systems at a limited number of Starwood
        properties in North America. The locations and potential dates of exposure for each
        affected Starwood property are listed ~çfe.

    •   The maiware affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of sale systems at
        the relevant Starwood properties. We have no indication at this time that our guest
        reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership systems were impacted.

    •   The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including
        cardholder name, payment card number, security code and expiration date. There is no
        evidence that other customer information, such as contact information, Social Security
        numbers or PiNs, were affected by this issue.

                                          Reference Guide

 We encourage affected customers to take the following steps:
 Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit
 www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit
 Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (‘FTC”) website at
 www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
 Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit
 reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form.
 When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
 Look in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit.
 Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer
 reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal
 information” section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social
 Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting
 agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning
 sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any
 inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the
 information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or
 charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency
 by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you.
 If the information can’t be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved.
 Information that can’t be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff’s office
 because it may signal criminal activity.

 to offer affected customers identity protection, credit monitoring and fraud assistance services
 for 12 months at no cost to them. These services start on November 20, 2015, and will be

 Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible
 identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you
 against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a
 merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice
 that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take
 steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by
 calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated
 telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer
 reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as
 described above.

 Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a ‘security
 freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to
 prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit fire at the consumer reporting agencies
 without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze,
 which generally range from $5420 per action. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security
 freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information
 on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the
 FTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state
 to state, please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more
 information.
 The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your
 request. For example, you may be asked to provide:

    •   Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, Ill)
    •   Your Social Security number
    •   Your date of birth
    •   Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
    •   A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s
        license or military ID card)
    •   Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account
        statement)

 General about steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may contact the Maryland
 Attorney General at:

                                  Frequently Asked Questions

1.     What happened?

We recently became aware of a maiware intrusion that affected some point of sale systems at a
limited number of Starwood hotels in North America. Promptly after discovering the issue, we
engaged third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation. Based on the
investigation, we discovered that the maiware affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other
point of sale systems at the relevant Starwood properties. We have no indication at this time that
our guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership systems were impacted.

2.     What did Starwood do when it discovered the issue?

Promptly after discovering the issue, we engaged third-party forensic experts to conduct an
extensive investigation. We also have been working closely with law enforcement authorities and
coordinating our efforts with the payment card organizations to determine the facts.

3.     What information may have been compromised?

The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including cardholder
name, payment card number, security code and expiration date. There is no evidence that other
customer information, such as contact information, Social Security numbers or PINs, were affected
by this issue.

4.     Which Starwood hotels in North America were impacted by this incident?

The locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood property are listed here.

5.   Is it safe to use a payment card at Starwood hotels?

The malware no longer presents a threat to customers using payment cards at our hotels.

6.     Is my payment card information affected?

Starwood cannot identify individual affected customers based on the payment card data the
company has available. This issue impacted a limited number of Starwood properties during
specific periods of time. Please refer to your payment card statements to see if you used a card at
one of the affected hotels during a relevant time period. If you believe your payment card was
affected or you see any unusual activity on your account statement, you should immediately
contact your bank or card issuer.

7.     What should I do to help protect my information?

If you believe your payment card may have been affected, you should immediately contact your
bank or card issuer. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                       Starwood Notifies Customers of Maiware Intrusion

 Stamford, Conn. November 20, 2015— Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
                       —


 (NYSE:HOT) announced today that the point of sale systems of a limited number of its
 hotels in North America were infected with malware, enabling unauthorized parties to
 access payment card data of some customers.

 Promptly after discovering the issue, Starwood engaged third-party forensic experts to
 conduct an extensive investigation to determine the facts. Based on the investigation,
 malware was detected that affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of
 sale systems at the relevant Starwood properties. There is no indication at this time
 that the Company’s guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest membership
 systems were impacted. The malware was designed to collect certain payment card
 information, including cardholder name, payment card number, security code and
 expiration date. There is no evidence that other customer information, such as contact
 information or PINs, were affected by this issue. The affected hotels have taken steps
 to secure customer payment card information and the malware no longer presents a
 threat to customers using payment cards at Starwood hotels.

 “Protecting our customers’ information is critically important to Starwood and we take
 this issue extremely seriously,” said Sergio Rivera, Starwood President, The Americas.
 “Quickly after we became aware of the possible issue, we took prompt action to
 determine the facts. We have been working closely with law enforcement authorities
 and have been coordinating our efforts with the payment card organizations. We want
 to assure our customers that we have implemented additional security measures to
 help prevent this type of crime from reoccurring.”

 Starwood encourages customers to carefully review and monitor their payment card
 account statements. If a customer believes his or her payment card may have been
 affected, the customer should immediately contact their bank or card issuer.
