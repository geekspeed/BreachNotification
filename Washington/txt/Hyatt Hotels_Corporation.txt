       Re:     Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

       Our client, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (“Hyatt”), recognizes the importance of protecting its
customers’ payment card data. On November 30, 2015, Hyatt was able to determine capabilities of
malware that had been initially detected six days earlier (just prior to Thanksgiving). The malware
was designed to target payment card data. Hyatt immediately expanded its investigation and hired
leading third-party security experts to examine its payment card network.

        On December 23, 2015, Hyatt issued a preliminary statement concerning its then-ongoing
investigation into the malware activity by posting a notice on its website and issuing a press release.
Findings from the now-complete investigation indicate the potential for unauthorized access to
payment card data from cards used onsite at certain Hyatt-managed locations, primarily at restaurants,
between August 13, 2015 and December 8, 2015. A small percentage of the at-risk cards were used at
spas, golf shops, parking, and a limited number of front desks, or provided to a sales office during this
time period. The at-risk window for a limited number of locations began on or shortly after July 30,
2015. The list of affected locations and potential at-risk timeframes has been posted on Hyatt.com.

       The malware was designed to search for payment card track data – cardholder name, card
number, expiration date and internal verification code – as the data was being routed through affected
payment processing systems and then write the data to an output file. The output files predominantly
contained track 2 data (which does not contain the cardholder name), but a small percentage contained

track 1 data as well. Although output files were created, we believe that not all of the output files were
collected.

       Hyatt has identified fifteen Washington residents where track 1 data from their card was found
in an output file and for whom Hyatt also has a physical address or email address. Beginning January
19, 2016, a letter or email will be sent to those individuals in accordance with Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §
19.255.010 in substantially the same form as the document enclosed herewith. In addition, because
other Washington residents may be affected, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 19.255.010 and
commencing January 14, 2016, Hyatt is providing substitute notification to Washington residents by
posting a statement on its website and issuing a press release in substantially the same form as the
documents enclosed herewith. Notification is being made without unreasonable delay.

        Hyatt has taken prompt action to resolve this issue and strengthen the security of its systems in
order to help prevent this from happening in the future. Hyatt has also been coordinating its efforts
with law enforcement and the payment card networks.

       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,



Theodore J. Kobus III

                    MESSAGE FROM GLOBAL PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS
                        Hyatt completes payment card incident investigation

Dear Hyatt Guest,

Protecting customer information is critically important to Hyatt. We have been working tirelessly to
complete our previously announced investigation regarding malware that targeted payment card data used
at Hyatt-managed locations. We now have more complete information we want to share so that you can
take steps to protect yourself.

The investigation identified signs of unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used onsite at
certain Hyatt-managed locations, primarily at restaurants, between August 13, 2015 and December 8,
2015. A small percentage of the at-risk cards were used at spas, golf shops, parking, and a limited number
of front desks, or provided to a sales office during this time period. The at-risk window for a limited
number of locations began on or shortly after July 30, 2015.

The malware was designed to collect payment card data – cardholder name, card number, expiration date
and internal verification code – from cards used onsite as the data was being routed through affected
payment processing systems. There is no indication that other customer information was affected.

The list of affected Hyatt locations and respective at-risk dates is available here. Additionally, for at-risk
transactions where a cardholder’s name was affected, we are in the process of mailing letters to customers
for whom we have a mailing address and sending emails to customers for whom we only have an email
address.

We worked quickly with leading third-party cyber security experts to resolve the issue and strengthen the
security of our systems in order to help prevent this from happening in the future. We also notified law
enforcement and the payment card networks. Please be assured that you can confidently use payment
cards at Hyatt hotels worldwide.

Most importantly, we encourage you to remain vigilant and to review your payment card account
statements closely. You should report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer immediately. Speak to
your card issuer for details because, while card issuers’ policies related to fraud may vary, payment card
rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely
manner.

Additionally, Hyatt has arranged for CSID to provide one year of CSID’s Protector services to affected
customers at no cost to them. CSID is one of the leading providers of fraud detection solutions and
technologies. In order to activate CSID’s Protector coverage, affected customers in the U.S. may visit
www.csid.com/hyatt-us and affected customers outside the U.S. may visit www.csid.com/hyatt-intl to
complete a secure sign up and enrollment process. You should also review the additional information in
the Reference Guide on ways to protect yourself.

If you have questions or would like more information, please call 1-877-218-3036 (U.S. and Canada)
or +1-814-201-3665 (International) from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. EST.

Please be assured that we take the security of customer data very seriously. We deeply regret the
inconvenience and any concern this may have caused you.

from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report,
please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the
three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

   Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com,1-888-397-3742
   TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has
been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney
General’s office in your state. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

   Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
   Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft
as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law
enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked
to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

____________________________________________________________________________
If you are a resident of Massachusetts, note that pursuant to Massachusetts law, you have the right to
obtain a copy of any police report.

Massachusetts law also allows consumers to request a security freeze. A security freeze prohibits a credit
reporting agency from releasing any information from your credit report without written
authorization. Be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or
prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment,
housing, or other services.

The fee for placing a security freeze on a credit report is $5.00. If you are a victim of identity theft and
submit a valid investigative report or complaint with a law enforcement agency, the fee will be
waived. In all other instances, a credit reporting agency may charge you up to $5.00 each to place,
temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. If you have not been a victim of identity theft,
you will need to include payment to the credit reporting agency to place, lift, or remove a security freeze
by check, money order, or credit card.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major
reporting agencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below:

   Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374,www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
   Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com,1-888-397-3742
   TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000,www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:
            1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)
            2. Social Security number
            3. Date of birth
            4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived
               over the prior five years
            5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill
            6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or
               ID card, military identification, etc.)
            7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative
               report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft

The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security
freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5)
business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number ("PIN") or password or both
that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you
must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper
identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or password provided to
you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would
like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The
credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to lift the security
freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

To remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus by mail
and include proper identification (name, address, and Social Security number) and the PIN number or
password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have three (3) business
days after receiving your request to remove the security freeze.

____________________________________________________________________________
If you are a resident of West Virginia, you also have the right to ask that nationwide consumer
reporting agencies place "fraud alerts" in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may
be a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your
name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability
to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer
reporting agencies. Contact information for each of the three credit reporting agencies is as follows:

   Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374,www.equifax.com, 1-800-525-6285
   Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com,1-888-397-3742
   TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022-2000,www.transunion.com, 1-800-680-7289

As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place
fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security
Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in
your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to
provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask
for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a
copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional
information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about
the identity theft report, visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft/.

You may also obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit
is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a security freeze on your
credit report pursuant to West Virginia law. The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency
from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans and services from being approved in your name
without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five business days
you will be provided a unique personal identification number (“PIN”) or password to use if you choose to
remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the distribution of your credit report
for a period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the
consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:

        (1) The unique personal identification number (“PIN”) or password provided by the consumer
        reporting agency;
        (2) Proper identification to verify your identity; and
        (3) The period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.

A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a
credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.

A security freeze does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account relationship and
a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of
account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities.

If you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security
freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either
completely if you are shopping around or specifically for a certain creditor, a few days before actually
applying for new credit.

Protecting customer information is critically important to Hyatt. We have been working tirelessly
to complete our previously announced investigation regarding malware that targeted payment
card data used at Hyatt-managed locations. We now have more complete information we want to

The investigation identified signs of unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used
onsite at certain Hyatt-managed locations, primarily at restaurants, between August 13, 2015 and
December 8, 2015. A small percentage of the at-risk cards were used at spas, golf shops, parking,
and a limited number of front desks, or provided to a sales office during this time period. The at-
risk window for a limited number of locations began on or shortly after July 30, 2015.

The malware was designed to collect payment card data – cardholder name, card number,
expiration date and internal verification code – from cards used onsite as the data was being
routed through affected payment processing systems. There is no indication that other customer
information was affected. The list of affected Hyatt locations and respective at-risk dates is
