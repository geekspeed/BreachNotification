 To Whom It May Concern:

 In accordance with R.C.W. 19.255.010, I am writing to provide you with an update regarding
 the nature and circumstances of the data security issue that Starwood Hotels & Resorts
 Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”) initially announced on November 20, 2015.

 As indicated in the letter I sent to your office on November 20, a malware intrusion affected
 some point of sale systems at a limited number of Starwood hotels in North America. Since
 that time, Starwood has been working diligently with third-party forensic experts to continue
 its investigation to help ensure that all impacted hotels have been identified. Based on the
 continued investigation, the company has identified some additional hotels whose point of
 sale systems were affected by this issue. As a general matter, the malware associated with
 these additional hotels was identified on point of sale systems that were decommissioned (j.~,
 taken offline and no longer operating) prior to the November 2015 announcement. To
 examine these decommissioned systems, which were located in storage at the relevant hotels,
 the forensic experts needed to conduct multiple system scans and manual inspections for signs
 of malware. This process required significant time and resources to complete. Attached is an
 updated list of locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood hotel.

 As indicated in my prior letter, the malware was designed to collect certain payment card
 information, including cardholder name, payment card number, security code and expiration
 date. There is no evidence that other customer information, such as contact information,
 Social Security numbers or PINs, were affected by this issue. The malware affected certain
 restaurants, gift shops and other point of sale systems at the relevant Starwood properties.
 Starwood has no indication that its guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest
 membership systems were impacted.

 The affected hotels have taken steps to secure customer payment card information, and the
 malware no longer presents a threat to customers using payment cards at the hotels. Starwood

 Because Starwood does not collect the contact information of customers when they make
 purchases at retail outlets within the hotel properties, Starwood is unable to determine the
 number of Washington residents who may be affected by this issue. Attached for your
 reference is a copy of the updated substitute notice Starwood posted on its website on January
 22, 2016. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

January 22, 2016

Dear Starwood Customers:

I am writing to provide you with an update regarding the nature and circumstances of the data
security issue we initially announced on November 20, 2015. As indicated in my November
2015 letter, a malware intrusion affected some point of sale systems at a limited number of
Starwood hotels in North America. Since that time, we have been working diligently with third-
party forensic experts to continue our investigation to help ensure that all impacted hotels have
been identified. Based on the continued investigation, we have identified some additional hotels
whose point of sale systems were affected by this issue. The updated list of locations and
potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood property is provided hcrc•

As indicated in my prior letter, we discovered that the point of sale systems at certain Starwood
hotels were infected with malware, enabling unauthorized parties to access payment card data of
some of our customers. We want you to know that the affected hotels have taken steps to secure
customer payment card information, and the malware no longer presents a threat to customers
using payment cards at our hotels. We also want to assure you that protecting the security of our
customers’ personal information is a top priority for Starwood.

As indicated in my prior letter, we have determined the following:

   •   The malware affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of sale systems at the
       relevant Starwood properties. We have no indication that our guest reservation or
       Starwood Preferred Guest membership systems were impacted.

   •   The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including
       cardholder name, payment card number, security code and expiration date. There is no
       evidence that other customer information, such as contact information, Social Security
       numbers or PINs, were affected by this issue.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause. We take our obligation to safeguard
personal information very seriously and are alerting affected customers about this incident so
they can take steps to help protect their information. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free
credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order
your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.
We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your
free credit reports. If you believe your payment card may have been affected, please contact
your bank or card issuer immediately.

In addition, we have arranged with AllClear ID to offer identity protection and credit monitoring
services to affected Starwood customers for one year at no cost to them. The Reference Guide
provides information on registration and recommendations by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission on the protection of personal information.
If you have any questions or would like more information, please call 1-855-270-9179 (U.S. and
Canada) or 1-512-201-2201 (International), Monday through Saturday, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm CST.

Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this issue may cause.

Sincerely,

Sergio Rivera
President, The Americas
                                          Reference Guide

We encourage affected customers to take the following steps:

Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit
www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit
Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) website at
www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports
only through the website, toll-free number or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open.
Look in the “inquiries” section for names of creditors from whom you haven’t requested credit.
Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer
reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the “personal information”
section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social Security
number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the
telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible
identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your
report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and,
if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize,
immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing.
Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information can’t be
explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that can’t be explained
also should be reported to your local police or sheriffs office because it may signal criminal
activity.

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly
notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity
theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC and your state Attorney
General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these
steps:

    •   Place an initial fraud alert.
    •   Order your credit reports.
    •   Create an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit by submitting a report about the theft at
        http://www.ftc.gov/complaint or by calling the FTC.
    •   File a police report about the identity theft and get a copy of the police report or the report
        number. Bring your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit with you when you file the police report.
    •   Your Identity Theft Report is your FTC Identity Theft Affidavit plus your police report.
        You may be able to use your Identity Theft Report to remove fraudulent information from
        your credit report, prevent companies from refurnishing fraudulent information to a
        consumer reporting agency, stop a company from collecting a debt that resulted from
        identity theft, place an extended seven-year fraud alert with consumer reporting agencies,
        and obtain information from companies about accounts the identity thief opened or misused.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of
identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placinu a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity
theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the
possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks
the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may
be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of
the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free
numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag
your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For more information on fraud
alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

 Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a “security
freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to
prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies
without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze,
which generally range from $5-$20 per action. Unlike afraud alert, you must place a security
freeze on your creditfile at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information on
security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the FTC as
described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state,
please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.

The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request.
For example, you may be asked to provide:

    •   Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., 11, 111)
    •   Your Social Security number
    •   Your date of birth
    •   Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
    •   A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver’s license or
        military ID card)
    •   Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)

For Maryland Residents. You can obtain information from the Maryland Office of the Attorney
General about steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may contact the Maryland Attorney
General at:

Maryland Office of the Attorney General
Consumer Protection Division
200 St. Paul Place
Baltimore, MD 21202
(888) 743-0023 (toll-free in Maryland)
(410) 576-6300
www.oag.state.md.us

For Massachusetts Residents. You have the right to obtain a police report and request a security
freeze as described above. The consumer reporting agencies may charge you a fee of up to $5 to
place a security freeze on your account, and may require that you provide certain personal
information (such as your name, Social Security number, date of birth, and address) and proper
identification (such as a copy of a government-issued ID card and a bill or statement) prior to
honoring your request for a security freeze. There is no charge, however, to place, lift or remove a
security freeze if you have been a victim of identity theft and you provide the consumer reporting
agencies with a valid police report.

                                    Frequently Asked Questions

1.     What happened?

We became aware of a malware intrusion that affected some point of sale systems at a limited number
of Starwood hotels in North America. Promptly after discovering the issue, we engaged third-party
forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation. Based on the investigation, we discovered that
the malware affected certain restaurants, gift shops and other point of sale systems at the relevant
Starwood properties. We have no indication that our guest reservation or Starwood Preferred Guest
membership systems were impacted.

2.     What did Starwood do when it discovered the issue?

Promptly after discovering the issue, we engaged third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive
investigation. We also have been working closely with law enforcement authorities and coordinating
our efforts with the payment card organizations to determine the facts.

3.     What information may have been compromised?

The malware was designed to collect certain payment card information, including cardholder name,
payment card number, security code and expiration date. There is no evidence that other customer
information, such as contact information, Social Security numbers or PINs, were affected by this issue.

4.     Which Starwood hotels in North America were impacted by this incident?

The updated locations and potential dates of exposure for each affected Starwood property are listed
here.

5.   Has Starwood identified additional properties affected by this issue since its first
     notification in November 2015?

Yes. Even though our investigation was not complete at the time of our initial announcement in
November 2015, we believed it was in the best interest of our customers to quickly alert them at the
time based on the information we had. Since that time, we have been working diligently with third-
party forensic experts to continue our investigation to help ensure that all impacted hotels have been
identified. Based on our investigation, we have identified some additional hotels whose point of sale
systems were affected by this issue. The updated locations and potential dates of exposure for each
affected Starwood property are listed ~

6.   Is it safe to use a payment card at Starwood hotels?

The malware no longer presents a threat to customers using payment cards at our hotels.

7.     Is my payment card information affected?

Starwood cannot identify individual affected customers based on the payment card data the company
has available. This issue impacted a limited number of Starwood properties during specific periods of
time. Please refer to your payment card statements to see if you used a card at one of the affected
hotels during a relevant time period. If you believe your payment card was affected or you see any
unusual activity on your account statement, you should immediately contact your bank or card issuer.

8.     What should I do to help protect my information?
