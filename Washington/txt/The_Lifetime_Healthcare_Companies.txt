VIA OVERNIGHT DELIVER YAND E-MAIL PA ULAS(44 TG. WA. GO

Paula Selis, Esq.
Senior Counsel
Washington State Office of the Attorney General
Consumer Protection Division
800 5th Ave, Suite 2000
Seattle, WA 98104-3188

       Re.     Incident Notification

Dear Ms. Selis:

        Our client, The Lifetime Healthcare Companies ("LTHC"), including its affiliates
Excellus BlueCross BlueShield ("Excellus BCBS"), Lifetime Health Medical Group, Lifetime
Benefit Solutions, Lifetime Care, The MedAmerica Companies ("MedAmerica"), and Univera
Healthcare ("Univera"), on August 5, 2015, learned that cyber-attackers had executed a
sophisticated attack to gain unauthorized access to its Information Technology (IT) systems.
Further investigation revealed that the initial attack occurred on December 23, 2013. LTHC
worked closely with Mandiant, one of the world's leading cybersecurity firms, to conduct its
investigation and to remediate the issues created by the attack on its IT systems. LTHC notified
the FBI and continues to work closely with the agency on its investigation.

        LTHC's investigation has determined that the attackers may have possibly gained
unauthorized access to LTHC's members', patients', and other individuals' personal information,
including names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, member
identification numbers, financial account information, claims information and, in some instances,
clinical information. As to Excellus BCBS, Univera, and MedAmerica, these entities acquire
this information in their capacity as health plans, as administrators for self-funded accounts, or as
service providers, and in the case of Excellus BCBS, as a participant in the national BlueCard




   Atlanta    Chicago    Cincinnati    Cleveland     Columbus       Costa Mesa   Denver
Houston    Los Angeles   New York      Orlando      Philadelphia    Seattle   Washington, DC

program.' In these cases and without waiving any objection to personal jurisdiction or ERISA-
preemption, this notice is intended to satisfy obligations for Excellus, Univera and MedAmerica,
their self-funded accounts and customers, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) plans and BCBS
plans' self-funded accounts to notify your office about this incident.

       The investigation has not determined that any such data was removed from LTHC's
systems. We also have no evidence to date that such data has been used inappropriately.

        Although we know of no reports of identity theft or other fraud related to this incident,
LTHC is beginning to notify individuals affected by the incident on September 9, 2015. LTHC
is offering affected individuals two years of complimentary identity theft protection services
through Kroll, including credit monitoring powered by TransUnion. LTHC also is providing call
center support for those affected. In addition, LTHC is recommending that members regularly
review their explanation of benefits statements for suspicious activity. Should any member
identify a medical service listed on an explanation of benefits statement that was not received,
the member should immediately contact LTHC.

        LTHC is notifying Washington residents in substantially the same form as the letters
attached hereto.2 As covered entities the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 ("HIPAA"), the affiliates of LTHC are required to maintain procedures for responding to a
breach of security, and notification to Washington residents is being provided in compliance with
these procedures. See WASH. REV. CODE § § 19.255.010(9) & (10) see also 45 C.F.R. § § 160.103
and 164.400 et seq.

        Notification is being provided in the most expedient time possible and without
unreasonable delay pursuant to the investigation described above, which was necessary to
determine the scope of the incident; restore the reasonable integrity of the data system; and
identify the individuals potentially affected. See WASH. REV. CODE. § 19.255.010(16).

        In addition to remediating its IT systems of the issues raised by this cyberattack and to
help prevent something like this from happening in the future, LTHC has taken actions to
strengthen and enhance the security of its IT systems moving forward.

           Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,



Theodore J. Kobus III

of the recovery; they can dig deep to uncover all aspects of the theft, and then work with creditors,
collection agencies, utilities, government entities, and others to resolve it.

Dear Parent or Guardian of <<Mem berFirstNarne>> <<MemberLastNarne>>,
I am writing to inform you that Excellus BlueCross BlueShield ("Excellus BOBS") was the target of
a sophisticated cyberattack, and that some of your child's personal information may have been
accessed by the attackers. As part of our investigation, we notified the FBI and are fully cooperating
with its investigation into this attack.
We at Excellus BCBS take this issue seriously and regret the concern it may cause. I'm writing to
provide you information on the steps we are taking to protect your child's information moving forward.
What happened?
On August 5, 2015, we learned that cyberattackers had executed a sophisticated attack to gain
unauthorized access to our Information Technology (IT) systems. Our investigation further revealed
that the initial attack occurred on December 23, 2013. We worked closely with Mandiant, one of
the world's leading cybersecurity firms, to conduct our investigation and to remediate the issues
created by the attack on our IT systems.
Our investigation determined that the attackers may have gained unauthorized access to your
child's information, which could include your child's name, address, telephone number, date of
birth, Social Security number, member identification number, financial account information, and
claims information. The investigation has not determined that any such data was removed from
our systems. We also have no evidence to date that such data has been used inappropriately.
Why does Excellus BCBS have your child's information?
We believe your child has or had health plan coverage through another independent Blue Cross
Blue Shield (BCBS) plan, and that your child may have received services in the 31 county upstate
New York service area of Excellus BOBS. Excellus BOBS is a service provider in 31 upstate New
York counties to BOBS plans across the country.
What is Excellus BCBS doing to protect your child?
We recognize this issue can be frustrating and we are taking steps to protect your child. We are
providing protection and assistance to those affected by this cyberattack, including two years of
identity theft protection services.




                                                                                             9xxxx-0915 BC M
