                                  NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened

In January 2016, we sent our customers a notification that their credit card information and other
personal information may have been stolen due to a cyber attack on our website, BaileysOnline.com.
In that notice, we informed our customers that the compromise event began on September 25, 2015.

Following an extensive eight week forensic examination, we have recently learned that the cyber
attacks actually first occurred in December 2011. The forensic examination shows that beginning in
December 2011, a person or persons without authorization accessed and possibly stole credit card
information from our website belonging to our customers. The thief or thieves accessed our website
remotely and overcame our firewall and security protections. Of these exposed cards, nearly 25%
were MasterCard® cards, 64% were VISA® cards, and fewer than 5% and 6% were American
Express® and Discover® cards, respectively.

The number of people in your state that are affected is 8,844.

We cannot be certain whether their data was stolen. However, because there is a possibility that their
data was stolen, we are required by law to notify them that they made a purchase and/or opened an
account with Bailey's during the affected range.

What Information Was Involved

The types of information stolen appears to include credit card numbers, cardholder names, CCV
numbers, credit card expiration dates, addresses and phone numbers, email addresses, log- in and
password to BaileysOnline.com, and other information typed into our website related to their order.

The following information is NOT included in what was taken: PINs (personal identification
numbers), Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and other personally identifiable
information.

What We Are Doing

We have reported the theft to various law enforcement agencies, and are cooperating with them in
their investigation. We also have notified Wells Fargo Bank, which handles our credit card
transactions, along with MasterCard®, VISA®, American Express® and Discover®. We have no
indication that any PayPal accounts were impacted.
We have engaged a security consultant and have been implementing our consultant's
recommendations to strengthen our firewall and take other security protections (described
below). We have also replaced our server with new hardware. We are confident that there have been
no further data breaches since January 27, 2016.

      We Advise Them to Do

We strongly encourage them to take preventive measures now to help prevent and detect any misuse
of their information. Change their log-in and password for BaileysOnline.com. They may want to
cancel the credit card(s), if any, that they think they may have used at BaileysOnline.com. They may
also want to place a fraud alert or order a security freeze on their credit reports with the three major
credit reporting agencies: (1) Equifax: 1-800-525-6285; www.equifax.com; P.O. Box 740241,
Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; (2) Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742); www.eUerian.com; P.O.
Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; and (3) TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289; www.transunion.com; Fraud
Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790. They may want to ask for a
free copy of their credit report from each agency, and ask that only the last four digits of their Social
Security number appear on their credit reports.

There are several things that they may want to do to protect themselves against possible identity theft
if the information does get into the wrong hands. These include: (1) watch for phishing attempts and
malicious email; (2) watch for scam U.S. mail; and (3) stay alert to signs of identity theft.

The Federal Trade Commission has published some information about how to defend against identity
theft at: hgp:Hwww.consumer.fte.gov/features feature-0014-identity-theft. We suggest that they
submit a complaint with the FTC by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338) or going online at
httns:Hwww.ftccomolaintassistant. ao`,l.

Bailev's Commitment

We apologize for the inconvenience resulting from the theft by unknown people of their information
described above. Please note that we have taken immediate steps to prevent a reoccurrence. In this
regard, we have (1) replaced our servers; (2) enhanced our firewalls; (3) integrated mandatory
changes with respect to our passwords and (4) integrated new software into our website. Please know
that Bailey's is PCI compliant, never sells, trades or otherwise knowingly releases any personal
information of our customers, and is committed to offering the most secure user experience for our
customers.

For questions relating to this event please call (888) 582-3816 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
5:00 p.m. P.S.T. Monday through Friday.
